# Singularity Agent Memory
## Session 194 - CapabilityGapAnalyzerSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **CapabilityGapAnalyzerSkill** (PR #271, merged) - Meta-cognitive skill for autonomous self-introspection and goal generation
- Enables the agent to analyze its own skill inventory, identify missing integrations, score gaps by strategic impact, and generate concrete work plans
- 8 actions: inventory (list loaded skills), analyze_gaps (find missing integrations), score_gaps (prioritize by impact), generate_plan (session work plan), pillar_coverage (strengths/weaknesses per pillar), integration_map (bridge coverage), history (past analyses), mark_addressed (close resolved gaps)
- Classifies skills into 6 categories: revenue, replication, self_improvement, goal_setting, infrastructure, monitoring
- Detects missing bridge patterns between existing skills (e.g. revenue skills without event bridges)
- Scores gaps by pillar priority weights, revenue potential, and core capability importance
- Filters addressed gaps from future plans
- Persistent JSON storage for analyses, work plans, and gap resolution history
- Registered in autonomous_agent.py DEFAULT_SKILL_CLASSES
- 14 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/capability_gap_analyzer.py - New skill (713 lines)
- tests/test_capability_gap_analyzer.py - 14 new tests (195 lines)
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Added import and registration

### Pillar: Goal Setting (primary), Self-Improvement (secondary)
This closes the critical "set its own goals" loop. Previously GoalManager tracked goals but didn't generate them, StrategySkill assessed pillars but didn't identify concrete next steps. Now the agent can: inventory its skills -> analyze gaps -> score by impact -> generate work plan -> mark addressed -> repeat. This is the autonomous planning capability that enables true self-direction.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **GapAnalyzer-GoalManager Bridge** - Auto-create GoalManager goals from gap analysis work plans
2. **GapAnalyzer-AutonomousLoop Integration** - Wire gap analysis into the ASSESS phase of the autonomous loop
3. **Skill Dependency Graph** - Map which skills depend on which and find orphaned/disconnected skills
4. **Revenue Dashboard Integration** - Wire all revenue bridge stats into ObservabilitySkill dashboard
5. **Natural Language Data Queries** - Wire NaturalLanguageRouter into DatabaseRevenueBridge for plain-English SQL

## Session 193 - DatabaseRevenueBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **DatabaseRevenueBridgeSkill** (PR #270, merged) - Wires DatabaseSkill into revenue-generating paid data services (#1 priority from session 190)
- 5 paid data services with per-operation pricing:
  - Data Analysis ($0.01/query): Run analytical SQL queries on customer databases, read-only enforced
  - Schema Design ($0.02/table): Create database schemas from specifications
  - Data Import ($0.005/100 rows): Import JSON data into structured database tables with auto-schema
  - Report Generation ($0.015/report): Multi-section formatted reports with automatic statistics
  - Data Transformation ($0.008/transform): ETL-style transforms between tables (replace/append modes)
- 7 actions: analyze, design_schema, import_data, generate_report, transform_data, list_services, service_stats
- Revenue tracking: per-service, per-customer, total revenue, request success rates
- Persistent JSON storage for jobs, reports, schemas, revenue stats
- Security: analyze enforces read-only SQL (SELECT/WITH/EXPLAIN/PRAGMA only)
- Registered in autonomous_agent.py DEFAULT_SKILL_CLASSES
- 11 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/database_revenue_bridge.py - New skill (692 lines)
- tests/test_database_revenue_bridge.py - 11 new tests (146 lines)
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Added import and registration

### Pillar: Revenue Generation
This bridges DatabaseSkill (session 188) into the revenue pipeline. Previously the agent could interact with databases but had no billing/metering layer. Now every database operation generates trackable revenue. Revenue flow: Customer -> ServiceAPI -> DatabaseRevenueBridgeSkill -> DatabaseSkill -> SQLite -> BillingPipeline -> Revenue

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Scheduled Database Maintenance** - Auto-vacuum, index optimization, stale data cleanup via SchedulerSkill
2. **Database Migration Skill** - Schema versioning and migration management for evolving customer databases
3. **Cross-Database Join** - Query across multiple databases with virtual tables
4. **Revenue Dashboard Integration** - Wire DatabaseRevenueBridge + HTTPRevenueBridge stats into ObservabilitySkill
5. **Natural Language Data Queries** - Wire NaturalLanguageRouter into DatabaseRevenueBridge for plain-English SQL

## Session 192 - ExternalAPIMarketplaceSkill (2026-02-08)

- #1 priority from session 191 MEMORY: "External API Marketplace"
- **singularity/skills/api_marketplace.py**: New skill (580 lines) providing:
  - Browse: Catalog of 8 built-in APIs (weather, exchange rates, IP geolocation, DNS lookup, URL shortener, random data, JSON placeholder, public holidays) with category/tag/search filtering
  - Details: Full endpoint info including URL template, parameters, pricing, usage stats
  - Call: Execute API calls with per-call billing, tier discounts, rate limiting, quota enforcement
  - Subscribe: 4 subscription tiers (Free/Basic/Pro/Enterprise) with volume discounts (0-40%), rate limit multipliers (1-10x), monthly quotas (100 to unlimited)
  - Add/Remove API: Extend marketplace with custom API endpoints (builtin APIs protected from override/removal)
  - Usage: Per-customer and per-API usage tracking with spend breakdown
  - Revenue: Marketplace-wide revenue report with top APIs/customers, subscription + per-call revenue
  - Tiers: List all subscription tiers with pricing and features
  - Uses HTTPClientSkill as transport when available, falls back to simulation mode
  - Persistent JSON storage for custom APIs, subscriptions, and usage data
  - 9 actions: browse, details, call, subscribe, add_api, remove_api, usage, revenue, tiers
- **singularity/autonomous_agent.py**: Registered ExternalAPIMarketplaceSkill in DEFAULT_SKILL_CLASSES
- 21 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/api_marketplace.py - New skill (580 lines)
- tests/test_api_marketplace.py - 21 new tests (150 lines)
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Added import and registration

### Pillar: Revenue Generation
This completes the API-as-a-Service product layer. Previously, HTTPRevenueBridgeSkill handled raw HTTP proxying but customers had to know exact URLs and configure everything manually. Now the agent offers a curated marketplace of ready-to-use APIs with browsable catalog, one-click calls, subscription tiers with volume discounts, and automatic usage/revenue tracking. Revenue model: markup over free API costs + subscription fees.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Database-Revenue Bridge** - Wire DatabaseSkill into RevenueServiceSkill for paid data analysis queries
2. **Scheduled HTTP Health Checks** - Auto-setup health monitoring via SchedulerSkill presets + HTTPRevenueBridge tick()
3. **Revenue Dashboard Integration** - Wire HTTPRevenueBridge and WebhookDelivery stats into the dashboard/observability system
4. **APIMarketplace-EventBus Bridge** - Emit events on API calls for reactive monitoring and alerting
5. **Webhook Delivery Scheduler Preset** - Auto-retry failed webhooks via scheduler preset

## Session 191 - WebhookDeliverySkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **WebhookDeliverySkill** (PR #268, merged) - Reliable outbound webhook delivery with retries and tracking
- #1 priority from session 190 MEMORY: "Webhook Delivery via HTTPClient"
- **singularity/skills/webhook_delivery.py**: New skill (485 lines) providing:
  - Deliver: Send webhook payload with exponential backoff retries (configurable max_retries, base_delay, max_delay)
  - HMAC-SHA256 payload signing for webhook authentication (X-Webhook-Signature header)
  - Idempotency keys to prevent duplicate delivery
  - Status tracking per delivery (pending, delivered, failed, retrying)
  - Per-URL delivery statistics (success rate, attempts, failures)
  - Dead letter queue for permanently failed deliveries (pending action)
  - Persistent delivery log survives restarts
  - Uses HTTPClientSkill as transport via context.get_skill("http_client"), falls back to httpx/urllib
  - 7 actions: deliver, status, retry, history, configure, pending, stats
- **singularity/service_api.py**: Updated _fire_webhook() to route through WebhookDeliverySkill when registered, with backward-compatible fallback to direct httpx POST
- **singularity/autonomous_agent.py**: Registered WebhookDeliverySkill in DEFAULT_SKILL_CLASSES
- 15 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/webhook_delivery.py - New skill (485 lines)
- tests/test_webhook_delivery.py - 15 new tests (271 lines)
- singularity/service_api.py - Updated _fire_webhook for reliable delivery
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Added import and registration

### Pillar: Revenue Generation
ServiceAPI's _fire_webhook() previously used bare httpx.post() with no retries, signing, or tracking - failed deliveries were silently lost. Now webhook delivery is reliable, trackable, and billable. Customers can trust task completion callbacks. HMAC signing enables enterprise security requirements. Delivery stats enable billing for webhook relay services.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **External API Marketplace** - Catalog of pre-configured external API endpoints (weather, exchange rates, etc.) the agent can call as paid services
2. **Database-Revenue Bridge** - Wire DatabaseSkill into RevenueServiceSkill for paid data analysis queries
3. **Scheduled HTTP Health Checks** - Auto-setup health monitoring via SchedulerSkill presets + HTTPRevenueBridge tick()
4. **Revenue Dashboard Integration** - Wire HTTPRevenueBridge and WebhookDelivery stats into the dashboard/observability system
5. **Webhook Delivery Scheduler Preset** - Auto-retry failed webhooks via scheduler preset

## Session 190 - HTTPRevenueBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **HTTPRevenueBridgeSkill** (PR #266, merged) - Wires HTTPClientSkill into revenue-generating paid services (#1 priority from session 189)
- 4 paid HTTP services with per-call pricing:

- Revenue tracking: per-service breakdown, per-customer breakdown, total revenue, request success rates
- Persistent JSON storage for relays, monitors, history, revenue stats
- Scheduler integration: tick() method checks due monitors and runs health checks automatically
- Registered in autonomous_agent.py DEFAULT_SKILL_CLASSES
- 15 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/http_revenue_bridge.py - New skill (688 lines)
- tests/test_http_revenue_bridge.py - 15 new tests (172 lines)
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Added import and registration

### Pillar: Revenue Generation
This is the critical bridge that turns HTTP capability into actual revenue. Previously, HTTPClientSkill could make requests but had no billing/metering layer. Now every HTTP operation generates trackable revenue. Revenue flow: Customer -> ServiceAPI -> HTTPRevenueBridgeSkill -> HTTPClientSkill -> External API -> BillingPipeline -> Revenue

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Webhook Delivery via HTTPClient** - Wire HTTPClientSkill into ServiceAPI's webhook callbacks for task completion notifications
2. **External API Marketplace** - Catalog of pre-configured external API endpoints (weather, exchange rates, etc.) the agent can call as paid services
3. **Database-Revenue Bridge** - Wire DatabaseSkill into RevenueServiceSkill for paid data analysis queries
4. **Scheduled HTTP Health Checks** - Auto-setup health monitoring via SchedulerSkill presets + HTTPRevenueBridge tick()

- 8 actions: request (full HTTP with GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE/HEAD), get (shorthand), post_json, save_endpoint (Postman-like collections with template variables), call_endpoint, list_endpoints, history (with domain filtering and stats), configure (domain allow/blocklist)
- Security: HTTPS enforced for non-localhost, cloud metadata endpoints blocked (AWS/GCP/Alibaba), configurable domain allowlist/blocklist, per-domain rate limiting (60 req/min), request/response size caps, timeout enforcement
- Uses httpx (async) with urllib stdlib fallback for zero-dep mode
- Registered in autonomous_agent.py
- 24 new tests, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **HTTP-Revenue Bridge** - Wire HTTPClientSkill into RevenueServiceSkill for paid API integration services
2. **Webhook Delivery** - Use HTTPClientSkill to deliver webhook callbacks from ServiceAPI
3. **External API Marketplace** - Catalog of pre-configured external API endpoints the agent can call
4. **Database-Revenue Bridge** - Wire DatabaseSkill into RevenueServiceSkill for paid data analysis
5. **Scheduled HTTP Health Checks** - Auto-monitor endpoints via SchedulerSkill + HTTPClientSkill

- Read-only by default with explicit write-mode enablement for safety
- Schema analysis with column types, indexes, foreign keys, row counts
- Data import from JSON arrays and CSV text with auto table creation and type inference
- Statistical analysis: min/max/avg/sum, distinct counts, top values per column
- Export query results as JSON or CSV
- Safety: query length limits, result row caps, timeout protection
- Registered in autonomous_agent.py
- 29 new tests, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:

2. **Database-Revenue Bridge** - Wire DatabaseSkill into RevenueServiceSkill for paid data analysis
3. **Scheduled Database Maintenance** - Auto-vacuum, index optimization via SchedulerSkill
4. **Database Migration Skill** - Schema versioning and migration management
5. **Cross-Database Join** - Query across multiple databases with virtual tables


## Session 187 - Replay-Loop Integration (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Decision Replay + Conflict Detection AutonomousLoop Integration** (PR #263, merged) - #1 priority from session 186
- Wired DecisionReplaySkill and RuleConflictDetectionSkill into the autonomous loop's LEARN phase
- Complete self-improvement feedback loop: distill rules -> replay decisions -> weaken bad rules -> resolve conflicts
- 3 new methods: `_run_decision_replay` (batch replay recent decisions, identify regressions), `_auto_weaken_regression_rules` (find and weaken rules causing regressions via relevance-filtered replay detail), `_run_conflict_scan` (periodic rule conflict detection and resolution)
- 6 new config options: replay_enabled, replay_interval (default 5), replay_batch_size (default 20), auto_weaken_regressions, conflict_scan_enabled, conflict_scan_interval (default 10)
- 5 new stats fields: replay_runs, replay_regressions_found, rules_auto_weakened, conflict_scans, conflicts_resolved
- Journal entries now include replay/conflict results
- Impact report runs every 3rd replay for deeper analysis
- All fail-silent: replay and conflict are enhancements that won't break the loop
- 15 new tests (test_replay_loop_integration.py), all passing. 23 existing loop tests passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/autonomous_loop.py - Added replay/conflict integration (~200 lines)
- tests/test_replay_loop_integration.py - 15 new tests

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
This closes the most critical gap in the learning pipeline. Previously the agent could learn rules and consult them, but had NO automatic correction mechanism for bad rules. Now in the LEARN phase, after distillation creates/updates rules, the replay system backtests recent decisions and auto-weakens rules that would have caused regressions (undoing past successes). Additionally, conflict detection periodically scans for contradictory rules and resolves them. The complete pipeline is now: raw data -> distill into rules -> replay to verify -> weaken bad rules -> resolve conflicts -> consult in DECIDE phase.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Conflict Detection -> Autonomous Loop Integration** - Auto-run conflict scan periodically in LEARN phase (DONE - built this session)
2. **Cross-Preset Deduplication** - Some presets have overlapping schedules - deduplicate to reduce scheduler load
3. **Multi-Currency Support** - Extend billing pipeline with currency conversion rates
4. **Billing Alert Integration** - Auto-create alerts when billing health degrades via alert_incident_bridge
5. **Revenue Forecasting Dashboard** - Wire billing forecast data into loop iteration dashboard
6. **Fleet Orchestration Replay** - Apply replay analysis to fleet-level decisions

## Session 186 - RuleConflictDetectionSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **RuleConflictDetectionSkill** (PR #262, merged) - #1 priority from session 185: detect and resolve contradictions in learned rules
- 6 actions: scan (find conflicting rule pairs), resolve (resolve a specific conflict), scan_and_resolve (combined), conflicts (list all), status (summary stats), configure (adjust thresholds)
- 3 conflict detection methods: sentiment opposition (positive vs negative signals about same topic), category opposition (success_pattern vs failure_pattern), skill opposition (same skill_id with opposing sentiment)
- Smart resolution: winner picked by confidence gap → reinforcement count → recency → arbitrary tiebreak
- Loser rule weakened by configurable factor (default 0.5x), auto-retired if below threshold (default 0.05)
- Stopword filtering for better content word similarity (Jaccard on content words, not all tokens)
- Persistent conflict log and resolution history (max 500 conflicts, 200 history entries)
- Configurable: similarity_threshold, auto_resolve, min_confidence_gap, weaken_factor, retire_threshold
- Registered in autonomous_agent.py skill list
- 17 new tests (test_rule_conflict_detection.py), all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/rule_conflict_detection.py - New skill (~490 lines)
- tests/test_rule_conflict_detection.py - 17 new tests
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Added import and registration

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
As the agent accumulates distilled rules over time, contradictions are inevitable (e.g., "prefer Docker" AND "avoid Docker" for the same context). Without conflict detection, the agent receives contradictory advice during DECIDE phase, leading to inconsistent behavior. This skill automatically scans for and resolves contradictions, keeping the rule base clean and actionable. Combined with DecisionReplaySkill (session 185) and LearningDistillation (session 181), the agent now has a complete learning hygiene pipeline: distill → detect conflicts → resolve → replay to verify.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Decision Replay -> Autonomous Loop Integration** - Wire replay analysis into LEARN phase to auto-weaken rules causing regressions
2. **Conflict Detection -> Autonomous Loop Integration** - Auto-run conflict scan periodically in LEARN phase (like distillation runs every N iterations)
3. **Cross-Preset Deduplication** - Some presets have overlapping schedules - deduplicate to reduce scheduler load
4. **Multi-Currency Support** - Extend billing pipeline with currency conversion rates
5. **Billing Alert Integration** - Auto-create alerts when billing health degrades via alert_incident_bridge
6. **Revenue Forecasting Dashboard** - Wire billing forecast data into loop iteration dashboard

## Session 185 - DecisionReplaySkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **DecisionReplaySkill** (PR #TBD, merged) - Counterfactual analysis of past decisions using current learned rules
- 6 actions: replay (re-evaluate a specific past decision with current rules), batch_replay (replay multiple decisions and compare outcomes), impact_report (aggregate learning quality analysis), find_reversals (find decisions where current rules would choose differently), timeline (track decision quality trend over time), what_if (replay with custom hypothetical rules)
- Rule relevance scoring: keyword overlap, skill_id matching, choice/alternative matching, category alignment, tag overlap
- Support vs contradiction analysis: calculates weighted support/contradict scores for each decision using pattern matching
- Learning quality measurement: computes improvement rate (reversals that fix past failures vs those that undo successes)
- Impact reports: identifies most impactful rules by usage count across decisions
- Timeline trend analysis: compares early vs recent reversal rates to detect improving/declining/stable trends
- What-if analysis: compare custom hypothetical rules against actual learned rules on the same decision
- Persistent storage: JSON-backed replays (max 1000) and reports (max 100)
- Registered in autonomous_agent.py skill list
- 23 new tests (test_decision_replay.py), all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/decision_replay.py - New skill (584 lines)
- tests/test_decision_replay.py - 23 new tests
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Added import and registration

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
This is the "backtesting" layer for agent learning. Previously, the agent could learn rules (LearningDistillationSkill) and consult them during decisions (AutonomousLoop integration), but had NO way to verify if its learning actually improved decision quality. DecisionReplaySkill closes this gap by replaying past decisions with current rules and measuring:
1. How many past decisions would change (reversal rate)
2. How many changes would fix past failures (improvement rate)
3. How many changes would undo past successes (regression rate)
4. Which rules have the most impact across decisions
5. Whether decision quality is trending better or worse over time

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Rule Conflict Detection** - Detect when distilled rules contradict each other and resolve via confidence comparison
2. **Decision Replay -> Autonomous Loop Integration** - Wire replay analysis into LEARN phase to auto-weaken rules causing regressions
3. **Cross-Preset Deduplication** - Some presets have overlapping schedules - deduplicate to reduce scheduler load
4. **Multi-Currency Support** - Extend billing pipeline with currency conversion rates
5. **Billing Alert Integration** - Auto-create alerts when billing health degrades via alert_incident_bridge
6. **Revenue Forecasting Dashboard** - Wire billing forecast data into loop iteration dashboard


## Session 184 - BillingSchedulerBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **BillingSchedulerBridgeSkill** (PR #TBD, merged) - #1 priority from session 183: wire BillingPipelineSkill into SchedulerSkill for autonomous periodic billing
- 8 actions: setup (configure billing schedule with interval/retry), run_now (immediate billing cycle), status (automation status), configure_webhook (invoice delivery notifications), history (billing run history), pause (temp halt), resume (restart), health (reliability metrics & revenue trend)
- Billing automation: configurable intervals (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly), dry-run-first mode, auto-retry with backoff, consecutive failure tracking
- Event bus integration: emits billing.cycle.completed, billing.cycle.failed, billing.invoice.generated events for downstream automation
- Webhook invoice delivery: configurable URL with HMAC secret, event filtering, send/fail tracking
- Health monitoring: health score (0-100), success rate, avg revenue/cycle, revenue trend analysis (growing/stable/declining)
- tick() method for scheduler integration: checks schedule, runs dry-run first if configured, executes real billing cycle
- Added 'billing_automation' preset to SchedulerPresetsSkill BUILTIN_PRESETS: daily billing cycle + hourly health check + 12-hour status report
- 17 tests pass, all existing scheduler preset tests still pass (16/16)

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **SSL/Certificate Management** - Auto-provision SSL certs for deployed services
2. **Dashboard-ObservabilitySkill Integration** - Auto-pull metrics from ObservabilitySkill into dashboard
3. **Workflow Analytics Bridge** - Wire WorkflowAnalytics into TemplateEventBridge for deployed workflow performance tracking
4. **Multi-Currency Support** - Extend billing pipeline with currency conversion rates
5. **Billing Alert Integration** - Auto-create alerts when billing health degrades via alert_incident_bridge
6. **Revenue Forecasting Dashboard** - Wire billing forecast data into loop iteration dashboard
## Session 183 - BillingPipelineSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **BillingPipelineSkill** (PR #TBD, merged) - Automated end-to-end billing connecting UsageTrackingSkill to PaymentSkill
- 8 actions: run_billing_cycle (full cycle for all customers with dry-run support), bill_customer (single customer invoice), apply_credit (customer credit management), apply_discount (percentage/fixed discounts with expiry), billing_status (current period overview), billing_history (past cycles with revenue totals), configure (billing period/thresholds), forecast (revenue prediction from usage trends)
- Billing cycle automation: pulls usage -> calculates tier-based charges -> applies discounts/credits -> generates itemized invoices -> clears billed usage -> records cycle history
- Revenue forecasting: linear trend analysis from historical billing cycles with confidence levels
- Customer management: auto-register unknown customers, tier-based pricing (free/basic/premium/enterprise)
- 14 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Billing Scheduler Integration** - Wire BillingPipelineSkill into SchedulerSkill for automatic periodic billing
2. **SSL/Certificate Management** - Auto-provision SSL certs for deployed services
3. **Dashboard-ObservabilitySkill Integration** - Auto-pull metrics from ObservabilitySkill into dashboard

6. **Multi-Currency Support** - Extend billing pipeline with currency conversion rates

## Session 182 - Distillation-AutonomousLoop Integration (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Distillation-AutonomousLoop Integration** (PR #258, merged) - #1 priority from session 181 MEMORY
- Wired LearningDistillationSkill into the AutonomousLoop's DECIDE and LEARN phases, closing the full act→measure→distill→consult→act feedback loop
- **DECIDE phase enhancement**: New `_consult_distilled_rules()` method queries LearningDistillationSkill for success_pattern, failure_pattern, and skill_preference rules. Results attached to every decision as `distilled_insights` with preferred_skills, avoid_skills, and advice lists. Reasoning strings annotated with insight summaries.
- **LEARN phase enhancement**: New `_run_distillation()` method called after feedback_loop analysis. Triggers `learning_distillation.distill` to synthesize raw data into rules. Runs every N iterations (configurable, default 3). Auto-expires stale rules periodically.
- **4 new config options**: `distillation_enabled` (bool), `distillation_interval` (int), `consult_rules_in_decide` (bool), `min_rule_confidence` (float 0-1)
- **New stats**: `distillation_runs`, `rules_consulted`, `decisions_influenced_by_rules`
- **Journal enrichment**: DECIDE phase logs `rules_consulted`, LEARN phase logs `distillation_ran` and `rules_created`. Journal summaries now include full `phases` data.
- **Helper**: `_format_insight_annotation()` formats distilled insights as human-readable reasoning annotations
- AutonomousLoopSkill bumped v1.0.0 → v2.0.0
- 12 new tests (test_distillation_loop_integration.py), all passing. 11 existing tests passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/autonomous_loop.py - Enhanced DECIDE + LEARN phases (+226 lines, version bump)
- tests/test_distillation_loop_integration.py - 12 new tests (304 lines)

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
This completes the critical feedback loop between data collection and decision-making. Previously: outcomes were recorded → feedback analyzed → distillation synthesized rules. But those rules were never consulted during decisions, and distillation never ran automatically. Now the autonomous loop automatically distills learnings and consults them, creating a true self-improving agent that learns from its own experience across sessions.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Distillation → Prompt Evolution Bridge** - Auto-feed high-confidence distilled rules into PromptEvolutionSkill as prompt additions
2. **Cross-Preset Deduplication** - Some presets have overlapping schedules - deduplicate to reduce scheduler load
3. **Preset Performance Profiling** - Track execution time per preset task and flag slow tasks
4. **Rule Conflict Detection** - Detect when distilled rules contradict each other and resolve via confidence comparison
5. **Decision Replay/Audit** - Replay past decisions with current rules to see how behavior would differ

## Session 181 - LearningDistillationSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **LearningDistillationSkill** (PR #257, merged) - New capability for cross-session wisdom synthesis
- Addresses the critical gap: agent collects data from outcomes, feedback, experiments, profiler — but each session starts fresh without distilled learnings
- Synthesizes raw data from 4 sources into a persistent, queryable knowledge base of learned rules
- **8 actions**: `distill`, `query`, `add_rule`, `reinforce`, `weaken`, `expire`, `status`, `configure`
- **distill action**: Reads from outcome_tracker, feedback_loop, experiments, skill_profiler data files. Analyzes per-skill success rates, failure patterns, cost outliers, experiment winners, and execution speed. Creates categorized rules with confidence scores.
- **7 rule categories**: success_pattern, failure_pattern, cost_efficiency, skill_preference, timing_pattern, combination, general
- **Outcome distillation**: Groups outcomes by skill/action, computes success rates, identifies high-performers (>80%) and chronic failures (<30%), detects cost outliers (>2x average), extracts common error messages.
- **Feedback distillation**: Extracts applied adaptations with positive/negative outcomes into reusable rules.
- **Experiment distillation**: Converts concluded experiments with winners into skill preference rules with confidence scaled by trial count.
- **Profiler distillation**: Identifies fast skills (below 50% of average duration) for speed-preference rules.
- **Confidence mechanics**: Rules have 0-1 confidence. Reinforce increases asymptotically toward 1.0 (+20% of remaining gap). Weaken decays by 30%. Auto-expire removes old (<30 days) + low-confidence (<0.4) rules.
- **query action**: Filter rules by skill_id, category, min_confidence. Returns sorted by confidence descending, capped at 20.
- **Persistent storage**: JSON-backed with MAX_RULES=500, MAX_DISTILLATION_HISTORY=100 limits.
- 18 new tests (test_learning_distillation.py), all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/learning_distillation.py - New skill (897 lines)
- tests/test_learning_distillation.py - 18 new tests (268 lines)

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
Closes the gap between data collection and actionable wisdom. Previously, the agent had outcome tracking, feedback loops, and experiments to collect data, but no way to distill that data into reusable heuristics across sessions. Now, the agent can periodically run `distill` to synthesize learnings, then `query` at decision time to consult its accumulated wisdom before choosing actions. Rules strengthen with confirmation and weaken with contradiction, creating a living knowledge base that improves over time.

### What to Build Next

1. **Distillation → Autonomous Loop Integration** - Wire distill into the LEARN phase of autonomous loop, and query into the DECIDE phase
2. **Cross-Preset Deduplication** - Some presets have overlapping schedules - deduplicate to reduce scheduler load
3. **Preset Performance Profiling** - Track execution time per preset task and flag slow tasks
4. **Distillation → Prompt Evolution Bridge** - Auto-feed high-confidence rules into prompt evolution as prompt additions
5. **Rule Conflict Detection** - Detect when rules contradict each other and resolve via confidence comparison


## Session 180 - Preset Health Alerts via EventBus (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Preset Health Alerts via EventBus** (PR #256, merged) - #1 priority from session 179 MEMORY
- Enhanced SchedulerPresetsSkill (v2.0.0 → v3.0.0) with health monitoring and EventBus event emission for failing presets
- **3 new actions**: `health_alerts`, `configure_alerts`, `alert_history`
- **health_alerts action**: Scans all applied presets' scheduler tasks, computes failure streaks and success rates, emits EventBus events for failing tasks, detects recovery, reports per-preset health status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
- **Failure streak detection**: Tracks consecutive failures per task. Alerts after configurable threshold (default 3). Emits `preset.task_failed` event with task_id, preset_id, streak count, reasons, severity.
- **Success rate monitoring**: Alerts when task success rate drops below threshold (default 50%) with minimum 3 executions required.
- **Recovery detection**: When a previously-alerting task has consecutive successes (default 2), emits `preset.task_recovered` event and transitions to healthy.
- **Preset-level health**: Aggregates task health into preset status: healthy (all tasks OK), degraded (some failing), unhealthy (all failing). Emits `preset.unhealthy` event.
- **3 EventBus event topics**: `preset.task_failed` (per-task), `preset.unhealthy` (per-preset), `preset.task_recovered` (recovery)
- **configure_alerts action**: Runtime-adjustable thresholds: `failure_streak_threshold` (1-100), `success_rate_threshold` (0-100%), `recovery_streak_threshold` (1-100), plus toggle switches for each event type.
- **alert_history action**: View past alert events with filtering by preset_id, summary stats (task_failed, unhealthy, recovered counts).
- **Persistent state**: Alert state (per-task streaks, status), alert config, and alert history all persisted to disk via JSON, surviving agent restarts.
- **_emit_alert_event helper**: Follows same EventBus emission pattern as FleetHealthEventBridgeSkill - tries _skill_registry, then context, records locally even if EventBus unavailable.
- 16 new tests (test_preset_health_alerts.py), all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/scheduler_presets.py - Added health alerts (+409 lines, version bump)
- tests/test_preset_health_alerts.py - 16 new tests

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
Closes a critical gap in the autonomous monitoring loop. Previously, if a scheduler preset task started silently failing (e.g., self_tuning errors every cycle), the agent had no way to detect or react. Now, failure patterns are detected and emitted as EventBus events that AlertIncidentBridge can convert into incidents, enabling the full `observe → detect → alert → respond` loop for preset automation health.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Cross-Preset Deduplication** - Some presets have overlapping schedules (e.g., multiple presets polling the same skill) - deduplicate to reduce scheduler load
2. **Preset Performance Profiling** - Track execution time per preset task and flag slow tasks that may be starving the tick budget
3. **Throttle Auto-Tuning** - Use PipelineLearningSkill patterns to auto-tune throttle params based on observed tick performance
4. **Dependency Validation on Apply** - When applying a preset, warn if dependencies aren't already applied (softer than apply_with_deps)
5. **Health Alert → Auto-Heal Integration** - When preset.unhealthy events fire, automatically remove and re-apply the preset to attempt recovery

## Session 179 - Preset Dependency Graph (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Preset Dependency Graph** (PR #255, merged) - #1 priority from session 178 MEMORY
- Enhanced SchedulerPresetsSkill (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0) with dependency declarations and topological sorting
- **depends_on field**: Added to PresetDefinition dataclass. Each preset can declare which presets it depends on.
- **7 dependency edges** declared across built-in presets:
  - health_monitoring → alert_polling, adaptive_thresholds, dashboard_auto_check
  - self_assessment → self_tuning
  - feedback_loop → experiment_management
  - revenue_goals → revenue_goal_evaluation
  - circuit_sharing_monitor → fleet_health_auto_heal
- **dependency_graph action**: Visualize full dependency graph with roots, leaves, depths per node, cycle detection. Can zoom into single preset's transitive deps.
- **apply_with_deps action**: Apply a preset and all its transitive dependencies in correct topological order. Skips already-applied presets.
- **apply_all uses topological order**: Dependencies always applied before dependents. Returns apply_order in response data.
- **Kahn's algorithm** for topological sort, **DFS-based cycle detection**, **transitive dependency resolution** via BFS.
- 13 new tests (test_preset_dependency_graph.py), all passing. 44 existing tests passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/scheduler_presets.py - Added dependency graph (+297 lines)
- tests/test_preset_dependency_graph.py - 13 new tests

### Pillar: Self-Improvement / Operations
Without dependency ordering, presets could be applied in random order, causing downstream presets to reference data from upstream presets that haven't started yet. For example, dashboard_auto_check polls health data from health_monitoring - if the dashboard check runs before health monitoring is set up, it gets stale/empty data. Topological ordering ensures foundational presets are always applied before presets that depend on their output.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Preset Health Alerts via EventBus** - When preset tasks fail repeatedly, emit events so AlertIncidentBridge can create incidents
2. **Cross-Preset Deduplication** - Some presets have overlapping schedules - deduplicate
3. **Preset Performance Profiling** - Track execution time per preset task and flag slow tasks
4. **Throttle Auto-Tuning** - Use PipelineLearningSkill patterns to auto-tune throttle params based on observed tick performance
5. **Dependency Validation on Apply** - When applying a preset, warn if dependencies aren't already applied (softer than apply_with_deps)


## Session 178 - Scheduler Tick Rate Limiting (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Scheduler Tick Rate Limiting** (PR #253, merged) - #1 priority from session 177 MEMORY
- Enhanced SchedulerSkill (v2.0.0 → v3.0.0) with comprehensive tick rate limiting to prevent excessive execution when many presets (16+) are active
- **min_tick_interval**: Configurable minimum seconds between tick() calls (default 5s). Ticks called too soon are skipped.
- **max_tasks_per_tick**: Cap on tasks executed per tick (default 5). Prevents single tick from executing all due tasks.
- **max_tick_duration**: Time budget per tick (default 30s). Cut off long-running ticks to prevent loop starvation.
- **burst_window + burst_max_tasks**: Sliding window rate limit (default 20 tasks per 60s). Prevents task execution spikes.
- **priority_on_throttle**: When throttled, most overdue tasks execute first (sorted by next_run_at ascending).
- **configure_throttle action**: Runtime adjustment of all 7 throttle parameters with validation.
- **throttle_status action**: Full observability - config, stats, burst budget remaining, due count, tick history with summary.
- **Tick history tracking**: Records every tick (timestamp, tasks_run, duration, throttled) for burst detection and status reporting.
- **Throttle stats**: Tracks total_ticks, throttled_ticks, skipped_ticks, tasks_deferred, burst_throttles, duration_cutoffs.
- 14 new tests (test_scheduler_throttle.py), all passing. 21 existing scheduler tests passing (updated manifest count 10→12). 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/scheduler.py - Enhanced with rate limiting (+290 lines)
- tests/test_scheduler.py - Updated manifest assertion (10→12 actions)
- tests/test_scheduler_throttle.py - 14 new tests

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
Prevents runaway scheduler execution that starves the autonomous loop. With 16 scheduler presets active, unrestricted tick() could execute dozens of tasks per iteration, causing loop starvation and excessive compute costs. Rate limiting ensures controlled, predictable execution with full observability. The agent can now introspect its own scheduler behavior via throttle_status.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Preset Dependency Graph** - Presets should declare dependencies (e.g., dashboard_auto_check depends on health_monitoring) and apply in topological order
2. **Preset Health Alerts via EventBus** - When preset tasks fail repeatedly, emit events so AlertIncidentBridge can create incidents
3. **Cross-Preset Deduplication** - Some presets have overlapping schedules - deduplicate
4. **Preset Performance Profiling** - Track execution time per preset task and flag slow tasks
5. **Throttle Auto-Tuning** - Use PipelineLearningSkill patterns to auto-tune throttle params based on observed tick performance

## Session 177 - Scheduler Presets Expansion (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **4 New Scheduler Presets** (PR #252, merged) - Complete the autonomous automation suite
- #1-#5 priorities from session 176 MEMORY: goal stall, revenue goal evaluation, dashboard auto-check, fleet health auto-heal
- **singularity/skills/scheduler_presets.py**: 4 new BUILTIN_PRESETS added:
  - `goal_stall_monitoring` (pillar: goal_setting): stall_check every 4h + progress monitor every 30m via goal_progress_events skill. Detects stuck goals and emits alerts.
  - `revenue_goal_evaluation` (pillar: revenue): status every 30m + report every 2h + history every 12h via revenue_goal_auto_setter skill. Continuous revenue tracking.
  - `dashboard_auto_check` (pillar: operations): latest every 10m + trends every 1h + subsystem_health every 30m + alerts every 15m via loop_iteration_dashboard skill. Early degradation detection.
  - `fleet_health_auto_heal` (pillar: replication): monitor every 5m + fleet_check every 10m via fleet_health_events skill. Proactive capacity management.
  - Updated FULL_AUTONOMY_PRESETS to include all 16 presets
  - Updated _preset_priority() with complete 15-entry ordering for recommendations
  - Updated module docstring to document all preset types
- 11 new tests (test_scheduler_presets_expansion.py), all passing. 16 existing preset tests passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
These 4 presets close the gap between having the underlying skills (goal_progress_events, revenue_goal_auto_setter, loop_iteration_dashboard, fleet_health_events) and having them actually run autonomously. Previously, an agent with "full autonomy" mode was missing periodic stall detection, revenue tracking, dashboard health checks, and fleet healing. Now `apply_all` activates all 16 presets covering every critical subsystem. The agent can run truly hands-free with comprehensive monitoring across all four pillars.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Scheduler Tick Rate Limiting** - Add configurable min interval between scheduler ticks to prevent excessive execution when many presets are active
2. **Preset Dependency Graph** - Presets should declare dependencies (e.g., dashboard_auto_check depends on health_monitoring) and apply in topological order
3. **Preset Health Alerts via EventBus** - When preset tasks fail repeatedly, emit events so AlertIncidentBridge can create incidents
4. **Cross-Preset Deduplication** - Some presets have overlapping schedules (e.g., fleet health appears in both circuit_sharing_monitor and fleet_health_auto_heal) - deduplicate
5. **Preset Performance Profiling** - Track execution time per preset task and flag slow tasks that might cause loop delays

## Session 176 - LoopIterationDashboardSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **LoopIterationDashboardSkill** (PR #251, merged) - Unified view of all autonomous loop iteration stats
- #3 priority from multiple MEMORY sessions: "Loop Iteration Dashboard"
- **singularity/skills/loop_iteration_dashboard.py**: Aggregates data from autonomous loop journal, circuit breaker, scheduler, fleet health, goals, and reputation into a single coherent dashboard per iteration
  - Latest: Full dashboard for most recent iteration with enriched phase data, subsystem health, overall score, alerts
  - History: Iteration summaries with success rate tracking
  - Trends: Success rate, duration, and revenue trend analysis (first-half vs second-half comparison)
  - Compare: Side-by-side comparison of any two iterations with deltas
  - Subsystem health: Per-subsystem scoring (loop execution, circuit breaker, scheduler, fleet health, goal progress, reputation) with configurable weights and weighted overall health score (0-100)
  - Alerts: Degradation pattern detection - low success rate, slow iterations, failure streaks, revenue decline with configurable thresholds
  - Configure: Adjust alert thresholds, trend window size, subsystem weights
  - 7 actions: latest, history, trends, compare, subsystem_health, alerts, configure
- 13 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
Previously, understanding what happened during an autonomous loop iteration required reading multiple data files (loop journal, circuit breaker state, scheduler, fleet, goals, reputation) and correlating timestamps manually. This skill provides a single-pane-of-glass view of iteration performance, enabling the agent to detect degradation patterns, identify weak subsystems, and make data-driven decisions about what to optimize. Combined with the autonomous loop's journal, the agent now has full iteration-level observability across ALL subsystems.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Goal Stall Scheduler Preset** - Add scheduler preset for periodic stall checks (every 4h) so stalled goals trigger automated alerts
2. **Revenue Goal Evaluation Preset** - Add scheduler preset that periodically runs RevenueGoalAutoSetter.evaluate() to keep goals current
3. **Dashboard Auto-Check Preset** - Add scheduler preset that runs dashboard periodically and emits events on degraded health
4. **Fleet Health Auto-Heal Preset** - Add scheduler preset that periodically triggers fleet health checks and auto-heal
5. **Loop Dashboard Event Bridge** - Emit EventBus events when loop iteration dashboard detects alerts/degradation

## Session 175 - PipelineLearningSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **PipelineLearningSkill** (PR #250, merged) - Auto-tune pipeline optimization from execution outcome data
- #1 priority from session 174: "Pipeline Learning"
- Ingests pipeline execution results to build per-tool performance profiles (success rate, duration percentiles, cost)
- Auto-recommends optimization strategies per pipeline type based on historical performance
- Uses Wilson score confidence intervals for ranking strategies with small sample sizes
- Tunes step parameters (timeouts, retries, cost limits) from real execution data instead of hardcoded defaults
- Identifies bottleneck tools that consistently fail or exceed budgets
- Tracks strategy effectiveness across pipeline types - agent learns which strategy works best for each type
- 7 actions: ingest, tool_profile, recommend, bottlenecks, strategy_effectiveness, tune_step, status
- 18 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/pipeline_learning.py - New skill (659 lines)
- singularity/skills/__init__.py - Import and export
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Import and register skill
- tests/test_pipeline_learning.py - 18 tests

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
Closes the act → measure → adapt feedback loop for pipeline execution. Previously PipelinePlannerSkill had static optimization strategies. Now strategies are data-driven: the agent records outcomes, learns per-tool profiles, and auto-tunes future pipelines based on what actually worked.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Workflow Auto-Trigger** - Auto-execute workflows based on EventBus events (e.g., on code push → run deploy workflow)
2. **Cross-Agent Pipeline Sharing** - Share pipeline templates between replicas via KnowledgeSharingSkill
3. **Pipeline Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time visibility into pipeline execution across fleet
4. **Revenue Pipeline Templates** - Pre-built pipeline templates for revenue-generating services
5. **Learning-Planner Integration** - Wire PipelineLearningSkill into PipelinePlannerSkill so optimize action uses learned data

## Session 174 - WorkflowPipelineBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **WorkflowPipelineBridgeSkill** (PR #249, merged) - Bidirectional bridge between WorkflowSkill and PipelineExecutor
- #1 priority from session 173: "Workflow-Pipeline Integration"
- Converts workflow definitions into PipelineExecutor step dicts for fast batch execution
- Converts pipeline plans into reusable WorkflowSkill workflow definitions
- Recommends optimal execution engine based on workflow characteristics (step count, duration, data deps, history)
- Records and compares execution performance across both engines for continuous learning
- 6 actions: workflow_to_pipeline, pipeline_to_workflow, recommend_engine, record_comparison, compare_engines, status
- Self-Improvement pillar: unifies execution engines so agent picks the best one per task
- 19 tests pass

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/workflow_pipeline_bridge.py - New skill (480 lines)
- singularity/skills/__init__.py - Import and export
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Import and register skill
- tests/test_workflow_pipeline_bridge.py - 19 tests

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
Unifies WorkflowSkill (persistent DAGs) and PipelineExecutor (fast batch execution) so the agent can choose the most efficient execution strategy. Engine recommendation learns from historical data.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Pipeline Learning** - Use outcome data from both engines to auto-tune optimization strategy per pipeline type
2. **Workflow Auto-Trigger** - Auto-execute workflows based on EventBus events (e.g., on code push → run deploy workflow)
3. **Cross-Agent Pipeline Sharing** - Share pipeline templates between replicas via KnowledgeSharingSkill
4. **Pipeline Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time visibility into pipeline execution across fleet
5. **Revenue Pipeline Templates** - Pre-built pipeline templates for revenue-generating services


## Session 173 - PipelinePlannerSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **PipelinePlannerSkill** (PR #248, merged) - Bridges PlannerSkill and PipelineExecutor for multi-step goal execution
- #1 priority from session 146: "Pipeline-Aware Planner"
- Converts a goal's dependency-ordered tasks into pipeline step dicts ready for PipelineExecutor.run_from_dicts()
- Enables the agent to think once (plan), then execute many steps in a single cycle instead of one-action-per-LLM-call
- 8 actions: generate, generate_from_tasks, optimize, estimate, save_template, load_template, record_outcome, status
- Topological sort (Kahn's algorithm) resolves task dependency graphs
- 3 optimization strategies: cost (minimize spend), speed (minimize time), reliability (retries + fallbacks)
- Cost budgeting: distribute total budget across steps proportionally
- Reusable pipeline templates with override support
- Outcome tracking with success rate analytics
- Self-Improvement pillar: force multiplier for planning efficiency
- 23 tests pass

### Files Changed
- singularity/skills/pipeline_planner.py - New skill (480 lines)
- singularity/skills/__init__.py - Import and export
- singularity/autonomous_agent.py - Register skill
- tests/test_pipeline_planner.py - 23 tests

### Pillar: Self-Improvement
Plan once, execute many. Reduces LLM calls per goal from N to 1+execution.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Workflow-Pipeline Integration** - Let WorkflowSkill use PipelineExecutor for efficient multi-step execution
2. **Pipeline Learning** - Use outcome data to auto-tune optimization strategy per pipeline type
3. **Fleet Orchestration Policies** - Pre-built fleet policies (cost-aware, resilience, revenue-optimized)
4. **Cross-Agent Pipeline Sharing** - Share pipeline templates between replicas
5. **Pipeline Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time visibility into pipeline execution across fleet
6. **Revenue Pipeline Templates** - Pre-built templates for common revenue tasks (code review, content gen, etc.)

## Session 172 - RevenueGoalAutoSetter (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **RevenueGoalAutoSetterSkill** (PR #247, merged) - Auto-set revenue goals from RevenueAnalyticsDashboard forecast data
- #1 priority from session 163 MEMORY: "Revenue Goal Auto-Setting"
- **singularity/skills/revenue_goal_setter.py**: Data-driven revenue goal bridge:
  - Evaluate: Reads forecast data (growth rate, current revenue, compute cost) and decides whether to create/update goals
  - Auto-breakeven goal: When revenue < compute cost, creates critical-priority breakeven goal with milestone tracking at 25/50/75/100%
  - Auto-growth goal: When profitable, creates growth goal targeting configurable margin multiplier above compute cost
  - Escalation detection: Flags when actual revenue exceeds target by >25%, prompting goal raises
  - Downgrade warnings: Alerts when forecast projects revenue declining below target by >20%
  - Manual set_goal: Create revenue goals with custom targets and deadlines
  - Sync: Force-sync current revenue data into active goal progress notes, auto-complete milestones
  - Status: View all auto-created and manual revenue goals with progress
  - Configure: Adjust thresholds (min snapshots, margin multiplier, escalation/downgrade %, priorities)
  - History: View all goal-setting decisions with forecast context
  - Duplicate prevention: Won't create duplicate breakeven/growth goals
  - Direct GoalManager integration: Creates goals in goals.json with proper pillar/priority/milestones
  - 6 actions: evaluate, set_goal, status, configure, history, sync
- 15 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
Previously, the agent had RevenueAnalyticsDashboard with forecast capabilities and GoalManager for tracking goals, but no bridge between them. Revenue goals had to be manually created. Now the agent autonomously sets revenue targets based on actual performance data, creates breakeven goals when not profitable, growth goals when profitable, and detects when targets need escalation or downgrade. This completes the revenue data -> forecast -> auto-goal -> track progress -> adapt targets feedback loop. Combined with SchedulerSkill for periodic evaluation, the agent can now fully autonomously manage its own revenue targets.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Goal Stall Scheduler Preset** - Add scheduler preset for periodic stall checks (every 4h) so stalled goals trigger automated alerts
2. **Revenue Goal Evaluation Preset** - Add scheduler preset that periodically runs RevenueGoalAutoSetter.evaluate() to keep goals current
3. **Loop Iteration Dashboard** - Unified view of all stats tracked per iteration (scheduler, reputation, goals, circuits, fleet health)
4. **Dashboard Auto-Check Preset** - Add scheduler preset that runs dashboard periodically and emits events on degraded health
5. **Fleet Health Auto-Heal Preset** - Add scheduler preset that periodically triggers fleet health checks and auto-heal

## Session 171 - Fleet Health Loop Integration (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Fleet Health Loop Integration** (PR #246, merged) - Wire FleetHealthEventBridgeSkill into AutonomousLoop
- #1 priority from session 170 MEMORY: "Fleet Health Events in Autonomous Loop"
- **singularity/skills/autonomous_loop.py**: Two new integrations wired into _step() after ACT phase:
  - `_monitor_fleet_health(state)`: Called after every ACT phase. Calls FleetHealthEventBridgeSkill.monitor() to detect fleet management changes (heal, scale, replace, rolling update) and emit structured EventBus events. Enables downstream reactive automation: AlertIncidentBridge creates incidents on failed heals, StrategySkill reprioritizes on capacity changes, CircuitSharingEvents correlates circuit states with fleet health.
  - `_check_fleet_health(state)`: Periodic proactive fleet health check (every N iterations, configurable via `fleet_check_interval`, default=5). Calls FleetHealthEventBridgeSkill.fleet_check() to analyze fleet for critical conditions (too many unhealthy replicas, capacity drops) and emit fleet_health.fleet_alert events. Rate-limited to avoid excessive overhead.
  - Both fail-silent: missing skills or exceptions gracefully skipped
  - New config option: `fleet_check_interval` (default: 5) - controls how often fleet_check runs
  - New stats tracked: `fleet_health_monitors`, `fleet_health_checks`
- 10 new tests (test_fleet_health_loop_integration.py), all passing. 13 existing loop tests passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
FleetHealthEventBridgeSkill (PR #242) was a standalone bridge that emitted fleet health events but nothing in the autonomous loop ever called it. Without this integration, fleet management actions (heal, scale, replace, rolling update) happened silently with no way for downstream skills to react. Now every loop iteration automatically monitors fleet health changes AND periodically checks for critical fleet conditions. Combined with the goal progress monitoring (session 169) and circuit sharing events (session 165), the agent now has full EventBus coverage across ALL critical subsystems: fleet management, circuit sharing, goal management, and reputation.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Goal Stall Scheduler Preset** - Add scheduler preset for periodic stall checks (every 4h) so stalled goals trigger automated alerts
2. **Scheduler Tick Rate Limiting** - Add configurable min interval between ticks to prevent excessive execution
3. **Loop Iteration Dashboard** - Unified view of all stats tracked per iteration (scheduler, reputation, goals, circuits, fleet health)
4. **Dashboard Auto-Check Preset** - Add scheduler preset that runs dashboard periodically and emits events on degraded health
5. **Fleet Health Auto-Heal Preset** - Add scheduler preset that periodically triggers fleet health checks and auto-heal

## Session 170 - Preset Status Dashboard (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Preset Status Dashboard** (PR #245, merged) - Rich operational dashboard for maintenance presets
- #1 priority from session 169 MEMORY: "Preset Status Dashboard"
- **singularity/skills/scheduler_presets.py**: New `dashboard` action in SchedulerPresetsSkill:
  - Per-preset health assessment: healthy/degraded/unhealthy based on task states
  - Per-task details: next run time (with overdue detection), interval, run count, last execution, last success status
  - Execution history analysis: success rate per task, average duration per task
  - Overall system health scoring: all_healthy/mostly_healthy/degraded/unhealthy/no_presets
  - Aggregate metrics: total tasks, healthy tasks, overdue tasks, disabled tasks, total executions, overall success rate
  - Filter by specific preset_id for focused inspection
  - Reads scheduler data directly from scheduler.json with skill context fallback
  - Reads execution history from scheduler with file fallback
  - Health status icons in message: OK/WARN/DEGRADED/CRITICAL/NONE
  - Also added `_read_scheduler_data()` helper method for querying scheduler state
- 10 new tests (test_preset_dashboard.py), all passing. 16 existing preset tests passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
Without observability, the agent can't know if its maintenance automation is working. This dashboard enables the agent to self-diagnose: "Are my scheduled tasks running? Are they succeeding? What's overdue?" - the prerequisite for self-healing. Combined with the scheduler tick integration (session 169), the agent now both EXECUTES and MONITORS its maintenance automation.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Fleet Health Events in Autonomous Loop** - Auto-call fleet_health_events.monitor() after fleet management actions in autonomous loop
2. **Goal Stall Scheduler Preset** - Add scheduler preset for periodic stall checks (every 4h)
3. **Scheduler Tick Rate Limiting** - Add configurable min interval between ticks to prevent excessive execution
4. **Loop Iteration Dashboard** - Unified view of all stats tracked per iteration (scheduler, reputation, goals, circuits)
5. **Dashboard Auto-Check Preset** - Add scheduler preset that runs dashboard periodically and emits events on degraded health

## Session 169 - Scheduler Tick + Auto-Reputation + Goal Progress Loop Integration (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Scheduler Tick + Auto-Reputation + Goal Progress Loop Integration** (PR #244, merged)
- Combined #3, #4, #5 priorities from session 168 MEMORY into one PR
- **singularity/skills/autonomous_loop.py**: Three critical integrations wired into _step():
  - `_tick_scheduler(state)`: Called at start of each iteration, accesses SchedulerSkill via registry, calls tick() to execute due scheduled tasks. Without this, all 9+ maintenance preset tasks (adaptive threshold tuning, revenue goal tracking, experiment management, circuit sharing monitoring) were registered but NEVER executed. Tracks scheduler_ticks and scheduler_tasks_executed in stats.
  - `_poll_auto_reputation(state)`: Called after ACT phase, calls AutoReputationBridgeSkill.poll() to auto-sync delegation outcomes to agent reputation scores. Task delegations that complete/fail during ACT now automatically update reputation.
  - `_monitor_goal_progress(state)`: Called after ACT phase, calls GoalProgressEventBridgeSkill.monitor() to emit EventBus events for goal state transitions. Goals progressing during ACT trigger downstream automation (StrategySkill reprioritize, alerts, etc).
  - All three fail-silent: missing skills gracefully skipped
  - Stats tracked: scheduler_ticks, scheduler_tasks_executed, reputation_polls, goal_progress_monitors
- 13 new tests, all passing. 11 existing loop tests passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
This closes the biggest operational gap in the autonomous loop. Previously, maintenance presets scheduled 9+ recurring tasks but they NEVER executed because scheduler.tick() was never called. Now every loop iteration: (1) executes due scheduled tasks, (2) syncs delegation reputation, (3) monitors goal progress. The agent is now truly self-maintaining - scheduled maintenance (threshold tuning, revenue tracking, experiment lifecycle, circuit monitoring) actually runs, reputation stays in sync with work outcomes, and goal progress triggers reactive automation.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Preset Status Dashboard** - Add a status action to see which maintenance presets are active, next run times, success rates
2. **Fleet Health Events in Autonomous Loop** - Auto-call fleet_health_events.monitor() after fleet management actions in autonomous loop
3. **Goal Stall Scheduler Preset** - Add scheduler preset for periodic stall checks (every 4h)
4. **Scheduler Tick Rate Limiting** - Add configurable min interval between ticks to prevent excessive execution
5. **Loop Iteration Dashboard** - Unified view of all stats tracked per iteration (scheduler, reputation, goals, circuits)

## Session 168 - GoalProgressEventBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **GoalProgressEventBridgeSkill** (PR #243, merged) - Emit EventBus events when goals transition states
- #1 priority from session 167 MEMORY: "Goal Progress EventBus Bridge"
- **singularity/skills/goal_progress_events.py**: Bridge between GoalManagerSkill and EventBus:
  - Monitor: Check goal state for changes since last call, emit events for new goals, completed milestones, completed/abandoned goals, pillar shifts
  - Stall Check: Detect goals idle past configurable threshold and emit stall events
  - 6 event types: goal.created, goal.milestone_completed, goal.completed, goal.abandoned, goal.progress_stalled, goal.pillar_shift
  - Snapshot-based change detection: compares current vs previous goal state (IDs, milestones, pillars)
  - Watermark deduplication: no duplicate events on repeated monitor calls
  - Configurable emission flags per event type (emit_on_created, emit_on_completed, etc.)
  - Configurable priority levels per event type (completed=high, stalled=high, etc.)
  - Stall detection: configurable idle threshold (default 24h), scans progress notes and milestone timestamps
  - Pillar distribution shift detection: alerts when goal focus shifts significantly between pillars
  - Fallback goal state reading: skill context -> direct file read
  - Dual emission path: tries _skill_registry first, falls back to self.context
  - Persistent state (snapshots, event history, config, stats) survives restarts
  - 6 actions: monitor, configure, status, history, emit_test, stall_check
- 25 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
GoalManagerSkill creates, completes, and abandons goals but these transitions happened silently with no way for downstream skills to react. Now StrategySkill can reprioritize when goals complete or stall, RevenueGoalAutoSetter can react when revenue goals are achieved, AlertIncidentBridge can flag stalled critical goals, AutonomousLoop can adjust focus based on goal lifecycle. This closes the goal lifecycle -> reactive automation loop. Combined with FleetHealthEventBridge (session 167) and CircuitSharingEventBridge (session 165), the agent now has full EventBus coverage across its three most critical subsystems: fleet management, circuit sharing, and goal management.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome
2. **Preset Status Dashboard** - Add a status action to see which maintenance presets are active, next run times, success rates
3. **Scheduler Tick Integration in Loop** - Call scheduler.tick() from AutonomousLoopSkill._step() to actually execute due scheduled tasks
4. **Goal Progress Events in Autonomous Loop** - Auto-call goal_progress_events.monitor() after goal actions in autonomous loop
5. **Goal Stall Scheduler Preset** - Add scheduler preset for periodic stall checks (every 4h)

## Session 167 - FleetHealthEventBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **FleetHealthEventBridgeSkill** (PR #242, merged) - Emit EventBus events when fleet health management actions occur
- #1 priority from session 166 MEMORY: "Fleet Health EventBus Integration"
- **singularity/skills/fleet_health_events.py**: Bridge between FleetHealthManagerSkill and EventBus:
  - Monitor: Check fleet health manager for new incidents since last call, emit events for heals, scales, updates, policy changes
  - Fleet Check: Analyze fleet health for critical conditions and emit alerts when unhealthy fraction exceeds threshold
  - 8 event types: fleet_health.heal_completed, fleet_health.scale_up, fleet_health.scale_down, fleet_health.rolling_update, fleet_health.assessment, fleet_health.policy_changed, fleet_health.fleet_alert, fleet_health.test
  - Configurable emission flags per event type (emit_on_heal, emit_on_scale, etc.)
  - Configurable priority levels per event type (heal=high, fleet_alert=critical, etc.)
  - Unhealthy threshold: alert when fraction of unhealthy/dead agents exceeds configurable threshold (default 50%)
  - Watermark-based deduplication: tracks last_incident_ts to prevent re-emitting old incidents
  - Fleet health assessment change detection: emits assessment events when healthy/unhealthy/dead counts change
  - Persistent state (event history, config, stats, fleet snapshots) survives restarts
  - Dual emission path: tries _skill_registry first, falls back to self.context
  - 6 actions: monitor, configure, status, history, emit_test, fleet_check
- 29 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
FleetHealthManagerSkill performs critical fleet operations (heal, scale, replace, update) but these actions happened silently with no way for downstream skills to react. Now AlertIncidentBridge can create incidents on failed heals, StrategySkill can reprioritize when fleet capacity changes, RevenueGoalAutoSetter can adjust targets when fleet degrades, SchedulerPresets can trigger emergency maintenance on fleet alerts. This completes the reactive automation loop for fleet lifecycle management.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Goal Progress EventBus Bridge** - Emit events when GoalManager goals transition states (created, progressing, achieved, missed)
2. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome
3. **Preset Status Dashboard** - Add a status action to see which maintenance presets are active, next run times, success rates
4. **Scheduler Tick Integration in Loop** - Call scheduler.tick() from AutonomousLoopSkill._step() to actually execute due scheduled tasks
5. **Fleet Health Events in Autonomous Loop** - Auto-call fleet_health_events.monitor() after fleet management actions in autonomous loop

## Session 166 - Maintenance Scheduler Presets (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Maintenance Scheduler Presets** (PR #241, merged) - Add 4 new scheduler presets for periodic maintenance + auto-apply in autonomous loop
- #1 priority from session 165 MEMORY: "Adaptive Threshold Auto-Trigger" (plus #2 "Revenue Goal Scheduler Integration")
- **singularity/skills/scheduler_presets.py**: Added 4 new BUILTIN_PRESETS:
  - `adaptive_thresholds`: Auto-tune circuit breaker thresholds per skill (tune_all every 30min, profiles every 2h). Targets `adaptive_circuit_thresholds` skill.
  - `revenue_goals`: Auto-set/track/adjust revenue goals from forecast data (assess hourly, track 30min, adjust 2h). Targets `revenue_goal_auto_setter` skill.
  - `experiment_management`: Auto-conclude experiments and review learnings (conclude_all hourly, learnings every 4h). Targets `experiment` skill.
  - `circuit_sharing_monitor`: Monitor cross-agent circuit sharing state and emit fleet alerts (monitor 5min, fleet_check 10min). Targets `circuit_sharing_events` skill.
  - All 4 included in FULL_AUTONOMY_PRESETS for apply_all
- **singularity/skills/autonomous_loop.py**: Added `_ensure_maintenance_presets(state)` method:
  - Called at start of each `_step()` iteration (after adaptive wire)
  - Auto-applies all 4 maintenance presets via `scheduler_presets.apply`
  - Runs only once per agent lifetime (tracked in state["maintenance_presets_applied"])
  - Fail-silent: tolerates missing skills/presets
  - Tracks partial application (which presets succeeded)
- 22 new tests, all passing. 16 existing preset tests passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
Previously, critical maintenance skills (adaptive threshold tuning, revenue goal tracking, experiment lifecycle, circuit sharing monitoring) had to be manually scheduled or invoked. The agent couldn't autonomously maintain itself. Now on first autonomous loop iteration, all 4 presets are auto-applied, creating 9 recurring scheduled tasks that keep the agent self-tuning, revenue-tracking, experiment-managing, and fleet-monitoring without any human intervention. This is the "ops automation" layer that makes true autonomy practical.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Fleet Health EventBus Integration** - Wire FleetHealthManagerSkill actions (heal, scale, replace) to emit EventBus events
2. **Goal Progress EventBus Bridge** - Emit events when GoalManager goals transition states (created, progressing, achieved, missed)
3. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome
4. **Preset Status Dashboard** - Add a status action to see which maintenance presets are active, next run times, success rates
5. **Scheduler Tick Integration in Loop** - Call scheduler.tick() from AutonomousLoopSkill._step() to actually execute due scheduled tasks

## Session 165 - CircuitSharingEventBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **CircuitSharingEventBridgeSkill** (PR #240, merged) - Emit EventBus events when circuit states are shared across replicas
- #1 priority from session 164 MEMORY: "Circuit Sharing EventBus Integration" (was #3 in the list; #1 and #2 already existed)
- **singularity/skills/circuit_sharing_events.py**: Monitors CrossAgentCircuitSharingSkill operations and emits structured events:
  - Monitor: Check circuit sharing state for changes and emit events for adoptions, conflicts, new peers
  - Fleet Check: Analyze shared store for fleet-wide patterns (e.g., >50% circuits open across all peers)
  - 5 event types: circuit_sharing.state_adopted, circuit_sharing.sync_completed, circuit_sharing.conflict_resolved, circuit_sharing.peer_discovered, circuit_sharing.fleet_alert
  - Configurable emission flags, priority levels per event type
  - Fleet alert threshold: configurable fraction of open circuits that triggers critical alert
  - Known peer tracking with automatic discovery and trimming
  - Persistent state (known peers, event history, stats, config) survives restarts
  - Event history with topic filtering
  - emit_test action for verifying EventBus integration
  - Dual emission path: tries _skill_registry first, falls back to self.context
- **singularity/skills/autonomous_loop.py**: Integrated _sync_circuit_sharing_events() - auto-monitors after every ACT phase (fail-silent)
- 6 actions: monitor, configure, status, history, emit_test, fleet_check
- 20 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests pass. 11 loop tests pass.

### Why This Matters
CrossAgentCircuitSharingSkill shares circuit breaker states across replicas but operations happened silently. Now downstream skills react automatically: AlertIncidentBridge creates fleet-wide incidents, StrategySkill adjusts priorities when fleet capacity drops, FleetHealthManager reacts to shared circuit openings. This completes the reactive automation loop for fleet-wide failure management.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Adaptive Threshold Auto-Trigger** - Automatically run AdaptiveCircuitThresholdsSkill.tune_all periodically via SchedulerSkill
2. **Revenue Goal Scheduler Integration** - Auto-run revenue_goal_auto_setter.assess via SchedulerSkill on a recurring schedule
3. **Fleet Health EventBus Integration** - Wire FleetHealthManagerSkill actions (heal, scale, replace) to emit EventBus events
4. **Goal Progress EventBus Bridge** - Emit events when GoalManager goals transition states (created, progressing, achieved, missed)
5. **Experiment Scheduler Integration** - Auto-run ExperimentSkill.conclude_all periodically via SchedulerSkill


## Session 164 - RevenueGoalAutoSetterSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **RevenueGoalAutoSetterSkill** (PR #239, merged) - Auto-set revenue goals from RevenueAnalyticsDashboard forecast data
- #1 priority from session 163 MEMORY: "Revenue Goal Auto-Setting"
- **singularity/skills/revenue_goal_auto_setter.py**: Bridges forecast data with GoalManager:
  - Assess: Pull dashboard metrics (revenue, growth rate, margin, source diversity) and generate goal recommendations
  - Create Goals: Auto-create goals in GoalManager from 4 template types (breakeven, growth, diversification, margin_improvement)
  - Track: Monitor goal progress against actual revenue data with periodic checks
  - Adjust: Detect 25%+ changes in revenue/growth and trigger automatic goal reassessment
  - Report: Comprehensive performance report (goals created/achieved/missed, achievement rate, current state)
  - Configure: Stretch factor, priorities, cooldowns, max active goals
  - Status/History: View auto-setter state and goal creation history
  - Breakeven goals (critical priority) when revenue < compute cost
  - Growth goals with configurable stretch factor (default 20% above forecast)
  - Diversification goals when few revenue sources are active
  - Margin improvement goals when profit margin < 50%
  - Duplicate prevention (won't create same goal type twice while active)
  - Max active goals limit (configurable cap)
  - Cooldown between reassessments to prevent thrashing
- 8 actions: assess, create_goals, track, adjust, report, configure, status, history
- 16 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests pass.

### Why This Matters
The agent had revenue forecasts (RevenueAnalyticsDashboard) and a goal system (GoalManager) but no automated connection between them. Revenue targets were set manually or not at all. Now the agent can autonomously: assess its revenue state, set data-driven targets based on forecasts, track progress against those targets, and adjust goals when conditions change. This closes the forecast -> goal -> execute -> measure feedback loop for revenue generation - the agent can now self-direct its revenue strategy.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Fleet Health Monitor** - Use AgentSpawnerSkill + HealthMonitor to auto-heal unhealthy replicas
2. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome
3. **Circuit Sharing EventBus Integration** - Emit events when remote circuit states are imported (circuit_sharing.imported, circuit_sharing.conflict_resolved)
4. **Adaptive Threshold Auto-Trigger** - Automatically run AdaptiveCircuitThresholdsSkill.tune_all periodically via SchedulerSkill
5. **Revenue Goal Scheduler Integration** - Auto-run revenue_goal_auto_setter.assess via SchedulerSkill on a recurring schedule

## Session 163 - CircuitBreakerAdaptiveIntegration (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Circuit Breaker Adaptive Integration** (PR #238, merged) - Wire AdaptiveCircuitThresholdsSkill overrides into CircuitBreakerSkill._evaluate_circuit()
- #1 priority from session 162 MEMORY: "Circuit Breaker Adaptive Integration"
- **singularity/skills/circuit_breaker.py**:
  - `set_adaptive_source(adaptive_skill)`: Connect an AdaptiveCircuitThresholdsSkill for per-skill thresholds
  - `_get_effective_config(skill_id)`: Merge per-skill adaptive overrides with global config (override takes precedence, global fills gaps)
  - `_evaluate_circuit()`: Now uses per-skill config for failure_rate_threshold, consecutive_failure_threshold, cost_per_success_threshold, cooldown_seconds, half_open_max_tests
  - `wire_adaptive_thresholds(registry)`: Module-level utility function for easy wiring after skill registration
  - `_adaptive_source` attribute in __init__ (None by default, backward compatible)
- **singularity/skills/autonomous_loop.py**:
  - `_wire_adaptive_circuit_breaker()`: Auto-wires at the start of every loop iteration (fail-silent)
  - Import and call `wire_adaptive_thresholds` from circuit_breaker module
- 15 new tests, all passing. 17 existing circuit breaker tests still passing. 17 smoke tests passing.

### Why This Matters
Previously, AdaptiveCircuitThresholdsSkill could compute per-skill thresholds but had no way to inject them into the actual circuit evaluation. The circuit breaker always used static global thresholds. Now a skill like an LLM API (with 10% natural failure rate) can have a 70% threshold while a filesystem skill (0% baseline) has a 3% threshold. This is the final piece of the act -> measure -> adapt feedback loop for circuit breaker configuration. The agent's safety mechanisms are now truly self-tuning based on observed behavior.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Revenue Goal Auto-Setting** - Auto-set revenue goals from RevenueAnalyticsDashboard forecast data
2. **Fleet Health Monitor** - Use AgentSpawnerSkill + HealthMonitor to auto-heal unhealthy replicas
3. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome
4. **Circuit Sharing EventBus Integration** - Emit events when remote circuit states are imported (circuit_sharing.imported, circuit_sharing.conflict_resolved)
5. **Adaptive Threshold Auto-Trigger** - Automatically run AdaptiveCircuitThresholdsSkill.tune_all periodically via SchedulerSkill

## Session 162 - AdaptiveCircuitThresholdsSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **AdaptiveCircuitThresholdsSkill** (PR #237, merged) - Auto-tune circuit breaker thresholds per skill based on historical performance
- #1 priority from session 161 MEMORY: "Adaptive Thresholds"
- **singularity/skills/adaptive_circuit_thresholds.py**: Per-skill threshold auto-tuning:
  - Analyze: Compute statistical profile from circuit records (failure rate mean/std, cost patterns, failure bursts, recovery times)
  - Tune: Apply computed thresholds for a specific skill
  - Tune All: Analyze and tune all skills with sufficient data in one call
  - Profiles: View all skill performance profiles and computed thresholds
  - Algorithm: Sets thresholds at baseline + N × standard_deviations (configurable sensitivity)
  - Failure burst analysis: Computes max consecutive failure streak for consecutive threshold
  - Recovery time analysis: Measures avg time between failure bursts for optimal cooldown
  - Cost analysis: Sets cost/success threshold based on observed cost patterns with multiplier
  - Auto-apply mode: Optionally apply overrides immediately after analysis
  - get_override_for_skill() API: Designed for CircuitBreakerSkill integration
  - Persistent profiles, overrides, and tuning history across sessions
  - Synthesize records from summary data when raw records unavailable
  - 8 actions: analyze, tune, tune_all, profiles, history, configure, status, reset
- 17 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests pass.

### Why This Matters
Static global thresholds don't work for diverse skill portfolios. An LLM API with 10% natural failure rate needs different thresholds than a filesystem skill with 0% baseline. This skill observes each skill's actual behavior and computes statistically appropriate thresholds - the agent's safety mechanisms now self-tune based on reality. This closes the act → measure → adapt feedback loop for circuit breaker configuration.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Circuit Breaker Adaptive Integration** - Wire AdaptiveCircuitThresholdsSkill overrides into CircuitBreakerSkill._evaluate_circuit() so per-skill thresholds are actually used during evaluation
2. **Revenue Goal Auto-Setting** - Auto-set revenue goals from RevenueAnalyticsDashboard forecast data
3. **Fleet Health Monitor** - Use AgentSpawnerSkill + HealthMonitor to auto-heal unhealthy replicas
4. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome
5. **Circuit Sharing EventBus Integration** - Emit events when remote circuit states are imported

## Session 161 - CrossAgentCircuitSharingSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **CrossAgentCircuitSharingSkill** (PR #236, merged) - Share circuit breaker states across agent replicas
- #1 priority from session 160 MEMORY: "Cross-Agent Circuit Sharing"
- **singularity/skills/circuit_sharing.py**: Fleet-wide circuit breaker state sharing:
  - Export: Serialize local circuit breaker states into shareable snapshots
  - Import: Merge another agent's circuit states with configurable merge strategies
  - Shared Store: File-based shared store for replicas on same volume (Docker compatible)
  - Sync: Bidirectional pull+publish in one operation
  - Three merge strategies:
    - pessimistic (default): If ANY peer reports circuit OPEN, adopt locally (safest for budget)
    - optimistic: Only adopt OPEN if local circuit also shows failures (independent verification)
    - newest: Adopt whichever state was most recently updated (fast convergence)
  - Conflict resolution: Manual overrides (forced_open/forced_closed) never overridden
  - Minimum data thresholds: Peers need sufficient data points before their states are trusted
  - Pessimistic recovery: If local is OPEN but peer recovered (3+ consecutive successes), adopt CLOSED
  - Persistent sync history, peer tracking, and conflict resolution counts across sessions
  - 8 actions: export, import_states, sync, publish, pull, status, configure, history
- 15 new tests, all passing. 17 smoke tests pass.

### Why This Matters
When multiple agent replicas operate autonomously, each independently discovers skill failures - wasting budget. If replica A finds an API is down, replicas B, C, D still burn budget learning the same lesson. This skill solves this by broadcasting circuit state changes across the fleet. One failure signal protects the entire fleet (pessimistic mode). This is the missing piece for safe autonomous replication at scale.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Adaptive Thresholds** - Auto-tune circuit breaker thresholds based on historical skill performance patterns using AgentReflectionSkill data
2. **Revenue Goal Auto-Setting** - Auto-set revenue goals from RevenueAnalyticsDashboard forecast data
3. **Fleet Health Monitor** - Use AgentSpawnerSkill + HealthMonitor to auto-heal unhealthy replicas
4. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome
5. **Circuit Sharing EventBus Integration** - Emit events when remote circuit states are imported (circuit_sharing.imported, circuit_sharing.conflict_resolved)

## Session 160 - CronExpressionParser (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **CronExpressionParser** (PR #235, merged) - Zero-dependency cron expression parser + SchedulerSkill cron integration
- #1 priority from session 159 MEMORY: "Cron Expression Parser"
- **singularity/cron_parser.py**: Full cron parser supporting:
  - Standard 5-field: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week
  - Wildcards (*), ranges (1-5), lists (1,3,5), steps (*/5, 1-10/2)
  - Named months (jan-dec), named days (mon-sun)
  - Aliases: @hourly, @daily, @weekly, @monthly, @yearly
  - next_run() with fast-skip optimization (skips months/days/hours efficiently)
  - next_n_runs() for preview, matches() for validation
  - describe() for human-readable schedule descriptions
  - Wrap-around ranges for day-of-week
- **SchedulerSkill v2.0**: 
  - New `schedule_cron` action: schedule tasks via cron expressions
  - New `parse_cron` action: validate expressions, show upcoming runs with descriptions
  - Cron tasks compute next_run_at from expression after each execution
  - Cron tasks recompute next_run on load (survives restarts)
  - Pause/resume supports cron tasks (resume recomputes from expression)
  - List shows cron_description for cron tasks
  - Full backward compatibility with existing schedule/recurring
- 47 new tests (36 cron parser + 11 scheduler cron), all passing
- 21 existing scheduler tests pass (1 updated for new action count)
- 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Cross-Agent Circuit Sharing** - Share circuit breaker states across replicas so one replica's failure detection benefits the whole fleet
2. **Adaptive Thresholds** - Auto-tune circuit breaker thresholds based on historical skill performance patterns using AgentReflectionSkill data
3. **Revenue Goal Auto-Setting** - Auto-set revenue goals from RevenueAnalyticsDashboard forecast data
4. **Fleet Health Monitor** - Use AgentSpawnerSkill + HealthMonitor to auto-heal unhealthy replicas
5. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome

## Session 159 - CircuitBreakerEventBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **CircuitBreakerEventBridgeSkill** (PR #234, merged) - Emit EventBus events on circuit breaker state changes
- #1 priority from session 158 MEMORY: "Circuit Breaker EventBus Integration"
- **Polls** circuit breaker dashboard for state changes since last check
- **Emits** structured events to EventBus on every state transition:
  - circuit_breaker.opened - skill failed too much, circuit opened
  - circuit_breaker.half_open - cooldown elapsed, testing recovery
  - circuit_breaker.closed - skill recovered
  - circuit_breaker.forced_open - manual block
  - circuit_breaker.forced_closed - manual override
  - circuit_breaker.budget_critical - budget protection activated
- **Configurable** emission rules and priority mapping per transition type
- **Integrated into AutonomousLoop**: auto-syncs after every ACT phase (fail-silent)
- **Persistent state**: known circuit states and transition history survive restarts
- 6 actions: sync, configure, status, history, reset, emit_test
- 17 new tests, all passing. 20 existing loop+CB tests still pass. 17 smoke tests pass.

### Why This Matters
Circuit breaker state changes were invisible. Now AlertIncidentBridge can auto-create incidents when circuits open, AgentReflection can auto-reflect on failures, and ServiceMonitor can degrade gracefully — all reactively via EventBus. This completes the circuit breaker reactive safety loop.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Cron Expression Parser** - SchedulerSkill has a CRON type enum but no actual cron expression parsing implementation
2. **Cross-Agent Circuit Sharing** - Share circuit breaker states across replicas so one replica's failure detection benefits the whole fleet
3. **Adaptive Thresholds** - Auto-tune circuit breaker thresholds based on historical skill performance patterns using AgentReflectionSkill data
4. **Revenue Goal Auto-Setting** - Auto-set revenue goals from RevenueAnalyticsDashboard forecast data
5. **Fleet Health Monitor** - Use AgentSpawnerSkill + HealthMonitor to auto-heal unhealthy replicas

## Session 158 - Circuit Breaker Loop Integration (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **Circuit Breaker Loop Integration** (PR #233, merged) - Wire CircuitBreakerSkill into AutonomousLoop
- #1 priority from session 157 MEMORY: "Agent Loop Circuit Breaker Integration"
- Every skill execution in `_run_actions()` now automatically flows through the circuit breaker
- **Pre-execution check**: calls `circuit_breaker.check()` before each skill - if circuit is open, skips the skill
- **Post-execution recording**: calls `circuit_breaker.record()` with success/failure + duration_ms after each skill
- **Fail-open design**: circuit breaker unavailability or exceptions NEVER block the main loop
- **Internal skill exemption**: autonomous_loop, circuit_breaker, outcome_tracker, feedback_loop bypass CB to prevent deadlocks
- **New config options**: `circuit_breaker_enabled` (default: True), `circuit_breaker_skip_self` (default: True)
- **New stats**: `circuit_breaker_denials`, `circuit_breaker_recordings` tracked in loop state
- **Duration tracking**: enables cost-per-success circuit breaking from the CB skill
- 9 new tests, all passing. 11 existing loop tests still pass. 17 smoke tests pass.

### Why This Matters
The CircuitBreakerSkill (PR #232) was a standalone safety mechanism that nothing used. Without this integration, the autonomous loop would still call broken skills endlessly, draining budget. Now every skill execution automatically checks the circuit first and records outcomes - creating a true safety net for autonomous operation.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Circuit Breaker EventBus Integration** - Emit events on circuit state changes (CLOSED->OPEN, OPEN->HALF_OPEN, etc.) so AlertSkill and incident response can react automatically
2. **Cron Expression Parser** - SchedulerSkill has a CRON type enum but no actual cron expression parsing implementation
3. **Cross-Agent Circuit Sharing** - Share circuit breaker states across replicas so one replica's failure detection benefits the whole fleet
4. **Adaptive Thresholds** - Auto-tune circuit breaker thresholds based on historical skill performance patterns using AgentReflectionSkill data
5. **Revenue Goal Auto-Setting** - Auto-set revenue goals from RevenueAnalyticsDashboard forecast data


## Session 157 - CircuitBreakerSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **CircuitBreakerSkill** (PR #232, merged) - Runtime safety mechanism for autonomous operations
- Implements the Circuit Breaker pattern (Netflix Hystrix-style) for skill execution
- **Three-state circuit**: CLOSED (normal) -> OPEN (blocked) -> HALF_OPEN (testing) -> CLOSED (recovered)
- **Sliding window failure tracking**: Configurable window size, failure rate threshold (default 50%)
- **Consecutive failure detection**: Fast-path circuit opening after N consecutive failures
- **Cost-per-success breaker**: Opens when cost per successful request exceeds threshold
- **Budget-critical mode**: Auto-blocks non-essential skills when budget < $1 (essential_skills whitelist)
- **Manual overrides**: force_open/force_close for manual intervention
- **Persistent state**: Circuit states survive restarts via JSON persistence
- **Health dashboard**: Aggregate stats, worst performers, recent events
- 8 actions: record, check, status, force_open, force_close, reset, configure, dashboard
- 17 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

### Why This Matters
Without a circuit breaker, the autonomous agent can endlessly retry broken APIs, burning through its entire budget on failures. This is the missing safety net.

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Agent Loop Circuit Breaker Integration** - Wire CircuitBreakerSkill into the main agent loop so every skill execution automatically records outcomes and checks circuit state before execution
2. **Circuit Breaker EventBus Integration** - Emit events on circuit state changes so other skills (alerts, incident response) can react automatically
3. **Cron Expression Parser** - SchedulerSkill has a CRON type enum but no actual cron expression parsing
4. **Cross-Agent Circuit Sharing** - Share circuit breaker states across replicas
5. **Adaptive Thresholds** - Auto-tune circuit breaker thresholds based on historical skill performance patterns


## Session 156 - ReputationWeightedVotingSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **ReputationWeightedVotingSkill** (PR #230, merged) - Meritocratic consensus governance
- #1 priority from session 35 MEMORY (Reputation-Weighted Voting)
- Integrates AgentReputationSkill into ConsensusProtocolSkill: vote weights auto-derived from reputation
- **compute_vote_weight**: Reputation (0-100) → vote weight (0.1x-3.0x) via linear interpolation, neutral (50) = 1.0x
- **Category-aware weighting**: strategy/resource/task/scaling categories use different dimension weights
- **6 actions**: create_proposal, cast_vote, tally, run_election, get_voter_weight, configure
- **run_election**: Reputation-weighted plurality elections
- **Configurable**: Custom dimension weights, min/max weight bounds
- 15 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome
2. **Service Monitoring Dashboard** - Aggregate health, uptime, revenue metrics across deployed services
3. **Template-to-EventWorkflow Bridge** - Wire WorkflowTemplateLibrary instantiation into EventDrivenWorkflowSkill
4. **Delegation Dashboard** - Real-time view of all active delegations across the agent network
5. **Cross-Skill Reputation Integration** - Make consensus, delegation, and elections all share a single agent reputation view


## Session 155 - AdaptiveSkillLoaderSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **AdaptiveSkillLoaderSkill** (PR #TBD, merged) - Dynamically load/unload skills based on task patterns
- #3 priority from session 151: "Adaptive Skill Loading"
- Closes the gap: 130+ skills loaded always, but most tasks only need a handful
- Analyzes AgentReflectionSkill history to build skill usage profiles per task type
- Skill scoring with decay: frequently used skills score higher, stale ones decay over time
- Co-occurrence tracking: knows which skills are commonly used together
- Task-to-skill matching: given a task description, recommends relevant skills via keyword overlap + co-occurrence
- Hot/cold skill detection: identifies actively used vs idle skills for load/unload decisions
- Manual usage recording: agents can track skill usage even without full reflection data
- 8 actions: analyze, recommend, profile, record_usage, hot_skills, cold_skills, configure, status
- Persistent JSON storage for profiles, decisions, scores, and configuration
- 18 new tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Revenue Goal Auto-Setting** - Auto-set revenue goals from RevenueAnalyticsDashboard forecast data
2. **Pipeline Event Integration** - Emit events via EventBus during pipeline execution for reactive monitoring
3. **Skill Dependency Resolution** - Auto-detect and load skill dependencies when a skill is loaded
4. **Task Pattern Clustering** - Cluster similar tasks to improve skill recommendation accuracy
5. **Fleet Skill Specialization** - Different replicas specialize in different skill sets based on performance


## Session 154 - ReflectionGoalBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **ReflectionGoalBridgeSkill** (PR #TBD, merged) - Autonomous goal creation from reflection pattern analysis
- #1 priority from session 153: "Reflection-Driven Goal Setting"
- Bridges AgentReflectionSkill (pattern analysis) with GoalManagerSkill (goal creation/tracking)
- Weakness detection: identifies low success-rate tags, recurring improvement themes, declining performance, pillar zero-success
- Tag-to-pillar mapping: 25+ tag keywords automatically mapped to correct pillar (revenue, replication, self_improvement, goal_setting)
- Automatic goal recommendations: converts each weakness into a structured goal with title, description, milestones, priority, pillar
- Goal creation: creates goals in GoalManager directly (via SkillContext or direct file access fallback)
- Configurable thresholds: weak_tag_threshold, min_tag_occurrences, improvement_theme_threshold, scan_cooldown, auto_create_goals
- Deduplication: content-hash prevents duplicate recommendations across scans
- Tracking: monitors status of created goals back through goals.json, updates completion/abandonment stats
- Scan cooldown: prevents excessive re-scanning with configurable cooldown period
- Dry-run support for goal creation preview
- 8 actions: scan, create_goals, recommendations, dismiss, track, configure, history, status
