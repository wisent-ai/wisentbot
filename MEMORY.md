# Singularity Agent Memory

## Session 45 - TuningPresetsSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **TuningPresetsSkill** (PR #184, merged) - Pre-built tuning rules for SelfTuningSkill, the #1 priority from MEMORY
- 16 battle-tested tuning rule presets across 7 categories (latency, error_rate, cost, throughput, rate_limit, revenue, health)
- 5 curated bundles (stability, performance, cost_aware, revenue_focused, full_auto) for one-command deployment
- 7 actions: list_presets, preview, deploy, deploy_bundle, customize, list_bundles, status
- Agents can now deploy production-ready tuning rules instantly instead of configuring from scratch
- 13 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Revenue Service Catalog** - Pre-built service offerings deployable via ServiceAPI
2. **Fleet Health Monitor** - Use AgentSpawnerSkill + HealthMonitor to auto-heal unhealthy replicas
3. **SSL/Certificate Management** - Auto-provision SSL certs for deployed services
4. **Dashboard-ObservabilitySkill Integration** - Auto-pull metrics from ObservabilitySkill into dashboard
5. **Workflow Analytics Bridge** - Wire WorkflowAnalytics into TemplateEventBridge for deployed workflow performance tracking
6. **Workflow Template Auto-Deploy** - Auto-deploy popular templates on agent startup

## Session 44 - TemplateEventBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **WorkflowTemplateBridgeSkill** (PR #183, merged) - Bridge between WorkflowTemplateLibrary and EventDrivenWorkflowSkill (8 actions: deploy, bind, undeploy, list, status, redeploy, quick_deploy, catalog)
- **TemplateEventBridgeSkill** (PR #182, merged) - Extended bridge with batch deploy, preview, sync, and goal-based suggestions (7 actions: deploy, deploy_batch, preview, sync, list, undeploy, suggest)
- Together these two skills fully close the Template-to-EventWorkflow gap (#1 priority from previous sessions)
- 16+17 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass
