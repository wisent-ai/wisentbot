# Singularity Agent Memory

## Session 137 - ConfigTemplateSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **ConfigTemplateSkill** (PR #178, merged) - Agent configuration profiles and specialization templates
- Enables agents to define, store, apply, and share named configuration templates for specializing behavior
- Critical for Replication (configure replicas) and Revenue (specialize for different services)
- **10 actions**: list, get, create, snapshot, apply, diff, export, import_template, delete, status
- **5 built-in specialization templates**: code_reviewer, content_writer, data_analyst, ops_monitor, revenue_agent
- **list**: Browse all templates with category/tag filtering
- **create**: Define custom configuration templates with skills_enabled/disabled, parameters, tags
- **snapshot**: Capture current agent state as a reusable template (reads SkillContext registry)
- **apply**: Apply a template to configure the agent, with dry_run preview of changes
- **diff**: Compare two templates side by side (skill differences + parameter differences)
- **export/import_template**: Portable JSON bundles for cross-agent template sharing
- Persistent storage, apply history tracking, stats (created/applied/exported/imported)
- 19 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **DNS Automation** - Cloudflare API integration for automatic DNS records when deploying services
2. **Service Monitoring Dashboard** - Aggregate health, uptime, revenue metrics across deployed services
3. **Template-to-EventWorkflow Bridge** - Wire WorkflowTemplateLibrary instantiation into EventDrivenWorkflowSkill
4. **Pre-built Tuning Rules** - Ship default SelfTuningSkill rules for common patterns
5. **Revenue Service Catalog** - Pre-built service offerings deployable via ServiceAPI
6. **Fleet Health Monitor** - Use AgentSpawnerSkill + HealthMonitor to auto-heal unhealthy replicas

## Session 41 - AgentSpawnerSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **AgentSpawnerSkill** (PR #177, merged) - Autonomous replication decision-making and lifecycle management
- #5 priority from session 136 memory: "Agent Spawning Orchestrator"
- The "brain" of the Replication pillar - makes HIGH-LEVEL spawning decisions
- **7 actions**: evaluate, spawn, retire, fleet, policies, configure, history
- **evaluate**: Check all spawn policies against current state, auto-spawn if triggered (with dry_run mode)
- **spawn**: Create new replica with type (generalist/specialist/service_worker), budget, skills config
- **retire**: Stop and decommission underperforming or unneeded replicas
- **fleet**: View all managed replicas with status, budget allocation
- **policies**: View/update 4 built-in spawn policies (workload, capability_gap, resilience, revenue)
- **configure**: Global settings - max_replicas cap, daily_budget limit
- **4 trigger types**: workload (queue depth > threshold), capability_gap (critical missing skills), resilience (< min agents), revenue (demand > capacity)
- **Safety features**: daily budget caps, max replica limits, per-policy cooldowns, hourly spawn limits, dry-run mode
- Integrates with: ReplicationSkill (spawning), AgentNetworkSkill (registration), SelfAssessmentSkill (gap detection), TaskQueue (workload)
- 14 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

5. **Revenue Service Catalog** - Pre-built service offerings deployable via ServiceAPI
6. **Fleet Health Monitor** - Use AgentSpawnerSkill + HealthMonitor to auto-heal unhealthy replicas

## Session 136 - CapabilityAwareDelegationSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **CapabilityAwareDelegationSkill** (PR #175, merged) - Smart task routing based on agent capability profiles and reputation
- #5 priority from session 40 memory: "Capability-Aware Task Delegation"
- Bridges SelfAssessmentSkill (capabilities), AgentReputationSkill (trust), TaskDelegationSkill (assignment), AgentNetworkSkill (discovery)
- **6 actions**: match, delegate, profiles, history, configure, status
- **match**: Score agents against requirements (skills/categories), rank by capability (0.6) + reputation (0.4)
- **delegate**: Match + auto-delegate in one step with quality tracking
- **Category inference**: Auto-infers categories from task name keywords
- **27 skill-to-category mappings** across 6 categories
- 14 tests pass
