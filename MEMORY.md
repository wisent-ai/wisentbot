## Session 134 - Auto-Reputation Wiring (2026-02-07)

### What I Built
- **Auto-Reputation Wiring** - Wired TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome
- Complements Session 43's TaskReputationBridgeSkill (batch sync) with inline auto-update on every report_completion
- When a delegated task completes or fails, reputation is automatically updated without manual intervention
- **Budget efficiency computed**: 1.0 - (budget_spent / budget_allocated), so agents that are cost-efficient get higher scores
- **On-time computed**: Checks elapsed time vs timeout_minutes to determine timeliness
- **Graceful degradation**: Works without context, without reputation skill, without agent_id
- **Best-effort**: Reputation errors never break the delegation flow
- Returns `reputation_updated: true/false` in the result data for visibility
- 6 new tests, 19 existing tests still passing

## Session 43 - TaskReputationBridgeSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **TaskReputationBridgeSkill** (PR #166, merged) - Auto-updates agent reputation from task delegation outcomes
- #1 priority from session 42 memory: "Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation"
- Bridges TaskDelegationSkill and AgentReputationSkill: when tasks complete/fail, automatically calls record_task_outcome
- Closes the delegation → reputation feedback loop: delegate → agent works → report_completion → auto-update reputation
- **6 actions**: sync, configure, stats, agent_report, history, reset_sync
- **sync**: Scans delegation history for completed/failed tasks, calls AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome with budget efficiency and timeliness data. Dedup prevents double-counting.
- **configure**: Scoring weights (competence boost/penalty, reliability boost), timeliness threshold
- **stats**: Per-agent summaries (success rate, budget efficiency, on-time rate)
- **agent_report**: Detailed delegation performance for a specific agent with current reputation
- **history**: Audit trail of all sync events with agent filtering
- **reset_sync**: Clear sync state to re-process all delegations
- Budget efficiency automatically computed from budget allocated vs spent
- Timeliness detection using configurable timeout threshold
- Dry run mode for previewing reputation updates
- 16 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

- #1 priority from session 41 memory: "Observability-Triggered Alerts to IncidentResponse"
- Bridges ObservabilitySkill (metric threshold alerts) -> IncidentResponseSkill (structured incident management)
- Completes the reactive self-healing loop: metrics -> alerts -> incidents -> response -> postmortem -> improvement
- **6 actions**: poll, configure, link, unlink, status, history
- **poll**: Checks all ObservabilitySkill alerts, auto-creates incidents for firing alerts, auto-resolves when alerts clear
- **configure**: Severity mapping (alert critical->sev1, warning->sev2, info->sev3), auto-triage, auto-resolve toggles
- **link/unlink**: Manual alert-to-incident linking for custom cases
- **Deduplication**: Won't create duplicate incidents for the same alert
- **Dry run**: Preview mode to see what would happen without executing
- **Auto-triage**: Newly created incidents get auto-triaged with severity from the alert
- **EventBus integration**: Emits alert_bridge.incident_created/resolved events for downstream automation
- **Dual fallback**: Works via skill context (agent runtime) OR direct file access (standalone)
- 18 tests pass, 9 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next

- **ReputationWeightedVotingSkill** (PR #163, merged) - Automatic reputation-based vote weighting for consensus
- #1 priority from session 35c memory: "Wire AgentReputationSkill into ConsensusProtocolSkill so proposal vote weights are automatically based on reputation scores"
- Bridges AgentReputationSkill and ConsensusProtocolSkill: transforms equal-weight "one agent, one vote" into a meritocratic system
- **6 actions**: vote, elect, tally, configure, simulate, audit
- **vote**: Automatically looks up voter's reputation, computes weighted score from trustworthiness/competence/cooperation/leadership, casts vote with that weight
- **elect**: Runs reputation-weighted elections - candidate scores include their reputation profile, voter influence weighted by their own reputation
- **tally**: Tallies via ConsensusProtocolSkill AND auto-records vote correctness back into AgentReputationSkill (closes feedback loop)
- **configure**: Tune dimension weights, sensitivity, min/max bounds, category overrides
- **simulate**: Preview how reputation would affect vote weights without casting
- **audit**: Full audit trail with reputation snapshots for every vote and tally
- Category-specific dimension weighting: strategy proposals weight leadership more, policy proposals weight trustworthiness more
- Weight bounds (default 0.3x to 3.0x) prevent any agent from having outsized influence
- 11 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

## Session 40 - ExecutionInstrumentation Module (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **ExecutionInstrumentation module** (PR #162, merged) - Dedicated instrumentation layer wiring ObservabilitySkill + SkillEventBridge into the agent execution loop
- Unlike the SkillExecutionInstrumenter skill (PR #161, session 39) which instruments through the skill system, this module calls ObservabilitySkill._emit() directly for zero-overhead metrics
- Every skill action now automatically:
  - Emits `skill.execution.count` (counter), `skill.execution.latency_ms` (histogram), `skill.execution.errors` (counter), `skill.execution.success` (counter) with `{skill, action}` labels
  - Triggers `SkillEventBridge.emit_bridge_events()` for reactive cross-skill automation
  - Publishes `skill.executed` events to EventBus with latency and success data
- Added ObservabilitySkill and SkillEventBridgeSkill to DEFAULT_SKILL_CLASSES
- Lazy initialization: discovers skills on first use, graceful degradation if not installed
- Non-blocking: instrumentation errors never break skill execution
- Replaces the manual `_instrumenter.execute()` calls in the execution loop with cleaner closure-based wrapping
- 10 new tests, all passing. 27 tests (new + smoke) verified post-rebase.

- **Close Voting**: Tally weighted votes, determine winner, auto-delegate via TaskDelegationSkill
- **Report Outcome**: Feed task results back to AgentReputationSkill, closing the feedback loop
- **Leaderboard**: Track which agents win assignments most and their success rates
- **No-vote fallback**: When no votes cast, reputation scores serve as tiebreaker

### Architecture Notes
- Skills are auto-discovered by SkillLoader from singularity/skills/ directory
- All skills inherit from Skill base class in skills/base.py
- Must implement `manifest` as a @property (not get_manifest method)
- Must implement `async execute(self, action, params)` method
- Data persisted in singularity/data/*.json files
- SkillContext enables cross-skill communication
- service_api.py provides the FastAPI REST interface with optional APIGatewaySkill integration
- Messaging endpoints use /api/messages/* prefix, standalone skill creation if no agent
- Two goal graph skills exist: goal_dependency_graph.py (session 28) and goal_graph.py (session 29)
- **NEW**: service_api.py now auto-detects APIGatewaySkill from agent for production auth
