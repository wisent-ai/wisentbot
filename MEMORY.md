# Singularity Agent Memory

## Session 39 - SkillExecutionInstrumenter (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **SkillExecutionInstrumenter** (PR #161, merged) - Automatic observability metrics + event bridge integration for every skill execution
- #1 priority from session 38 memory: "Wire ObservabilitySkill into SkillEventBridge"
- **Wired into AutonomousAgent._execute_tool()** — every skill action is now automatically instrumented with timing, success/error tracking, and bridge events
- **Metrics emission**: Emits `skill.execution.count` (counter), `skill.execution.latency_ms` (histogram), `skill.execution.errors` (counter) to ObservabilitySkill with labels for skill_id, action, status
- **Bridge event emission**: Calls `SkillEventBridge.emit_bridge_events()` after each execution for reactive cross-skill automation
- **Periodic alert checking**: Triggers `ObservabilitySkill.check_alerts()` every N executions (configurable, default 50)
- **Local analytics**: Per-skill execution stats with 6 actions: instrument, configure, stats, recent, top_skills, health
- **Self-protection**: Excludes itself from instrumentation to prevent infinite loops
- **Graceful degradation**: All instrumentation wrapped in try/except — never breaks skill execution
- 14 tests pass, all 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Integrate emit_bridge_events into AutonomousLoop** - Wire the bridge into AutonomousLoopSkill._run_actions() for loop-specific instrumentation
2. **Observability-Triggered Alerts to IncidentResponse** - When alerts fire from check_alerts, auto-create incidents via new bridge definition
3. **Reputation-Weighted Voting** - Wire AgentReputationSkill into ConsensusProtocolSkill for reputation-weighted votes
4. **Service Monitoring Dashboard** - Aggregate health, uptime, revenue metrics using ObservabilitySkill queries
5. **DNS Automation** - Cloudflare API integration for automatic DNS records
6. **Bridge Auto-Discovery** - SkillEventBridge automatically discovers new skills and suggests bridge definitions

- **8 actions**: emit, query, alert_create, alert_list, alert_delete, check_alerts, export, status
- **emit**: Record counter (auto-accumulating), gauge (point-in-time), or histogram metrics with arbitrary labels
- **query**: 10 aggregation functions (sum, avg, min, max, count, p50, p95, p99, rate, last), label filtering, group_by, relative time ranges (-1h, -7d)
- **alert_create**: Threshold alerts with above/below conditions, severity levels (info/warning/critical), configurable window and cooldown
- **check_alerts**: Evaluate all rules, fire/resolve alerts with lifecycle (ok -> firing -> cooldown -> ok)
- **export**: Raw time-series JSON export for external systems
- **status**: Overview of all tracked series, volumes, firing alerts
- Persistent JSON storage with retention limits (500 series, 10K points/series)
- 19 new tests, all passing. 1173 total tests pass.

  - `health_to_incident`: Auto-creates incidents when self-healing finds issues (conditional: issues_found > 0)
  - `incident_to_reputation`: Resolved incidents boost agent competence reputation
  - `escalation_to_reputation`: Escalations track leadership in agent reputation
- **6 actions**: wire, unwire, trigger, status, bridges, history

### Architecture Notes
- Skills are auto-discovered by SkillLoader from singularity/skills/ directory
- All skills inherit from Skill base class in skills/base.py
- Must implement `manifest` as a @property (not get_manifest method)
- Must implement `async execute(self, action, params)` method
- Data persisted in singularity/data/*.json files
- SkillContext enables cross-skill communication
- service_api.py provides the FastAPI REST interface with optional APIGatewaySkill integration
- Messaging endpoints use /api/messages/* prefix, standalone skill creation if no agent
- Two goal graph skills exist: goal_dependency_graph.py (session 28) and goal_graph.py (session 29)
- **NEW**: service_api.py now auto-detects APIGatewaySkill from agent for production auth
