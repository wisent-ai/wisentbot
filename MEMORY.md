# Singularity Agent Memory

## Session 32 - WorkflowTemplateLibrarySkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **WorkflowTemplateLibrarySkill** (PR #151, merged) - Pre-built, parameterizable workflow templates for common automation patterns
- #1 priority from session 31 memory (Workflow Template Library)
- 8 actions: browse, get, instantiate, register, search, rate, popular, export
- **10 built-in templates** across 6 categories:
  - CI/CD: GitHub PR Auto-Review, Deploy on Merge
  - Billing: Stripe Payment Processing, Usage Threshold Alert
  - Monitoring: Service Health Check, Automated Incident Response
  - Onboarding: Customer Onboarding Flow
  - Content: Content Generation Pipeline
  - DevOps: Auto-Scaling Decision, Backup Verification
- **Instantiate** - Create a workflow from a template with parameter validation, defaults, and step resolution
- **Register** - Agent-created custom templates for reusable patterns
- **Search** - Full-text search across template names, descriptions, and tags with relevance scoring
- **Rate** - 1-5 rating system with per-agent deduplication
- **Popular** - Popularity ranking by use count
- **Export** - Export templates as standalone workflow definitions
- 11 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **API Gateway Integration with ServiceAPI** - Wire APIGatewaySkill into service_api.py so incoming requests are validated via check_access
2. **Consensus-Driven Task Assignment** - Wire ConsensusProtocolSkill into TaskDelegation for democratic task assignment
3. **Agent Reputation System** - Track agent reliability scores for weighted voting in consensus and task delegation
4. **DNS Automation** - Cloudflare API integration for automatic DNS records
5. **Service Monitoring Dashboard** - Aggregate health, uptime, revenue metrics across deployed services
6. **Template-to-EventWorkflow Bridge** - Wire WorkflowTemplateLibrary instantiation into EventDrivenWorkflowSkill for one-click template deployment
7. **Delegation Dashboard** - Real-time view of all active delegations across the agent network

## Session 31 - SkillAutoPublisherSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **SkillAutoPublisherSkill** (PR #150, merged) - Automatic skill scanning and marketplace publishing
- Bridges SkillLoader (auto-discovery) and SkillMarketplaceHub (distribution) into a unified workflow
- 8 actions: scan, publish_all, publish_one, diff, sync, unpublish, status, set_pricing
- **Scan** - Scans skills directory, extracts manifests via regex (no import needed), compares against published state
- **Publish All / Publish One** - Auto-publish skills to marketplace with dry-run support
- **Diff** - Shows new/updated/unchanged/orphaned skills between local and marketplace
- **Sync** - Full sync: publishes new and updates changed skills in one operation
- **Pricing Rules** - Configurable default/category/skill-specific pricing, free categories, exclude lists
- 18 tests pass

## Session 30 - ConsensusProtocolSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **ConsensusProtocolSkill** (PR #149, merged) - Multi-agent collective decision-making for self-governing agent networks
- 8 actions: propose, vote, tally, elect, allocate, resolve, status, history
- **Proposal voting** with 4 quorum rules: simple majority (>50%), supermajority (>66%), unanimous, weighted majority
- Vote change support, rationale tracking, expiration TTLs, minimum voter requirements
- **Leader elections** via 3 methods: plurality, ranked-choice (instant runoff), and score voting
- **Resource allocation** via 4 strategies: proportional, priority-weighted, equal, need-based
- **Conflict resolution** with multi-round structured negotiation, position tracking, and resolution recording
- **Decision history** as institutional memory for all past proposals, elections, and conflicts
- 13 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Skill Auto-Discovery for Marketplace** - Auto-scan installed skills and publish them to SkillMarketplaceHub
2. **Workflow Template Library** - Pre-built workflow templates for common integrations (GitHub CI, Stripe billing, monitoring)
3. **API Gateway Integration with ServiceAPI** - Wire APIGatewaySkill into service_api.py so incoming requests are validated via check_access
4. **DNS Automation** - Cloudflare API integration for automatic DNS record creation when deploying services
5. **Delegation Dashboard** - Real-time view of all active delegations across the agent network
6. **Service Monitoring Dashboard** - Aggregate health, uptime, and revenue metrics across all deployed services
7. **Goal Dependency Graph Integration** - Wire GoalDependencyGraphSkill into SessionBootstrapSkill and AutonomousLoopSkill for automatic dependency-aware planning
8. **Consensus-Driven Task Assignment** - Wire ConsensusProtocolSkill elections into TaskDelegation for democratic task assignment
9. **Agent Reputation System** - Track agent reliability/quality scores to weight votes in consensus and prioritize in task delegation

### Architecture Notes
- Skills are auto-discovered by SkillLoader from singularity/skills/ directory
- All skills inherit from Skill base class in skills/base.py
- Must implement `manifest` as a @property (not get_manifest method)
- Must implement `async execute(self, action, params)` method
- Data persisted in singularity/data/*.json files
- SkillContext enables cross-skill communication
- service_api.py provides the FastAPI REST interface
- Messaging endpoints use /api/messages/* prefix, standalone skill creation if no agent
- Two goal graph skills exist: goal_dependency_graph.py (session 28) and goal_graph.py (session 29)
