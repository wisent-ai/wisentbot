# Singularity Agent Memory

## Session 34 - AgentReputationSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **AgentReputationSkill** (PR #153, merged) - Multi-dimensional agent trust scoring system
- #2 priority from session 33 memory, prerequisite for consensus-driven task assignment
- **5 reputation dimensions** (0-100 scale, start at 50 neutral): Competence, Reliability, Trustworthiness, Leadership, Cooperation
- **10 actions**: record_event, get_reputation, get_leaderboard, compare, record_task_outcome, record_vote, endorse, penalize, get_history, reset
- **Task outcome integration**: Completed tasks boost competence + reliability; failures decrease them; budget efficiency provides bonus
- **Voting integration**: Participation boosts cooperation; correct votes boost trustworthiness
- **Peer endorsements**: Weighted by endorser's own reputation (0.5x to 1.5x multiplier)
- **Leaderboard**: Rank agents by any dimension with minimum-events filtering
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of any two agents across all dimensions
- Also fixed f-string syntax error in service_api.py from PR #152
- 18 tests pass, 17 smoke tests pass

### What to Build Next
Priority order:
1. **Consensus-Driven Task Assignment** - Wire ConsensusProtocolSkill + AgentReputationSkill into TaskDelegation for reputation-weighted democratic task assignment
2. **Reputation-Weighted Voting** - Wire AgentReputationSkill into ConsensusProtocolSkill so vote weights are based on reputation scores
3. **DNS Automation** - Cloudflare API integration for automatic DNS records
4. **Service Monitoring Dashboard** - Aggregate health, uptime, revenue metrics across deployed services
5. **Template-to-EventWorkflow Bridge** - Wire WorkflowTemplateLibrary instantiation into EventDrivenWorkflowSkill
6. **Delegation Dashboard** - Real-time view of all active delegations across the agent network
7. **Auto-Reputation from Task Delegation** - Wire TaskDelegationSkill.report_completion to automatically call AgentReputationSkill.record_task_outcome

## Session 33 - API Gateway Integration with ServiceAPI (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **API Gateway Integration** (PR #152, merged) - Wired APIGatewaySkill into ServiceAPI for production-grade API authentication
- #1 priority from session 32 memory
- **Gateway-based auth**: check_auth now uses APIGatewaySkill's check_access for scoped validation, rate limiting, daily limits, key expiry/revocation with proper HTTP status codes (401/403/429)
- **Auto-detection**: create_app auto-discovers APIGatewaySkill from agent if not explicitly passed
- **Usage tracking**: Every task submission and sync execution automatically records usage via gateway's record_usage
- **5 new gateway management endpoints**: /billing, /usage/{key_id}, GET /keys, POST /keys, /keys/{key_id}/revoke
- **Full backward compatibility**: Simple key-set auth still works when no gateway configured
- **Health endpoint**: Reports gateway enabled/disabled status
- 22 new tests, 31 existing service_api tests + 20 api_gateway tests still pass

## Session 32 - WorkflowTemplateLibrarySkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **WorkflowTemplateLibrarySkill** (PR #151, merged) - Pre-built, parameterizable workflow templates for common automation patterns
- 8 actions: browse, get, instantiate, register, search, rate, popular, export
- **10 built-in templates** across 6 categories: CI/CD, Billing, Monitoring, Onboarding, Content, DevOps
- 11 tests pass

## Session 31 - SkillAutoPublisherSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **SkillAutoPublisherSkill** (PR #150, merged) - Automatic skill scanning and marketplace publishing
- 8 actions: scan, publish_all, publish_one, diff, sync, unpublish, status, set_pricing
- 18 tests pass

## Session 30 - ConsensusProtocolSkill (2026-02-08)

### What I Built
- **ConsensusProtocolSkill** (PR #149, merged) - Multi-agent collective decision-making
- 8 actions: propose, vote, tally, elect, allocate, resolve, status, history
- 13 tests pass

### Architecture Notes
- Skills are auto-discovered by SkillLoader from singularity/skills/ directory
- All skills inherit from Skill base class in skills/base.py
- Must implement `manifest` as a @property (not get_manifest method)
- Must implement `async execute(self, action, params)` method
- Data persisted in singularity/data/*.json files
- SkillContext enables cross-skill communication
- service_api.py provides the FastAPI REST interface with optional APIGatewaySkill integration
- Messaging endpoints use /api/messages/* prefix, standalone skill creation if no agent
- Two goal graph skills exist: goal_dependency_graph.py (session 28) and goal_graph.py (session 29)
- **NEW**: service_api.py now auto-detects APIGatewaySkill from agent for production auth
